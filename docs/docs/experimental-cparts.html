<mws-Section name="state">Store</mws-Section>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>State vs Store?</strong> <em>State</em> and <em>Store</em> CParts
are identical except that <em>Store</em> is always shared between components,
while <em>State</em> is private and can only be shared by parents passing data
down as <em>Props</em>. Generally speaking, you will use <em>State</em> for
most data in your app, and <em>Store</em> only for data that is used in so many
places it's too inconvenient to be passing around via Props. Often,
<em>Store</em> is used for application data from a backend database that is
used in multiple places in an app.
</p></blockquote>


<p>The <em>Store</em> is for shared, global data between all component instances.
It's a way to store changing global data, such as API data from a backend
database service, or authentication data. It's behavior is almost identical to
the <em>State</em> CPart, but with two important exceptions: 1) There always
must be a "name" attribute, and 2) The data is shared between all
<em>Store</em> CParts with identical name attributes.</p>


<p>Store data is universal across every component instance.  For data only used
by one component instance, you should use a <em>State</em> CPart instead.</p>


<h3>Definition</h3>

<p>Store is traditionally included in Component definitions below the
<em>Script</em> CPart tag.  Store is defined in a similar way to <em>State</em>
or <em>Props</em>: Only defined with properties, but no contents.</p>

<p>See below for an example of defining a <em>Store</em> CPart:</p>

<mws-Demo
text='
<Store
    -name="userinfo"
    username="Luiz"
    favenum:=13
></Store>
'></mws-Demo>

<p>All other behavior of Store is the same as State.</p>


<mws-Section name="cparts">Props</mws-Section>

<h3>Definition</h3>

<p>Every "prop" within a <em>Props</em> CPart definition can be defined in one
of 4 ways:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Any type, required</strong> - Specify the name of the prop in
    the CPart definition, but give it no value. This will be able to receive
    data in any type (e.g. String, and/or a JSON type or Function set with
    <code>:=</code> data prop syntax). By default, all props are required,
    meaning if this component is used without a required prop being set, it
    will throw an error and will not render.</li>

    <li><strong>Type-checked, required</strong> - Give the name of a <em>type
    validator</em> as a value when defining a Prop to enforce data of only
    certain types being accepted by a Component. There are a number of built-in
    <em>type validators</em> that you can use for common types:
    <code>String</code>, <code>Number</code>, <code>Boolean</code>,
    <code>Array</code>, <code>Object</code>, <code>Date</code>, and
    <code>Function</code>. You can also create your own validators: The
    <em>type validator</em> can be the name of any function that will return
    <code>undefined</code> if the given prop is of an incorrect type, or
    the value of the prop (with any necessary "casting" or conversion applied)
    if it's a valid Prop.  The Props CPart will then use these validators to
    provide more helpful error messages. If you want to support more than one
    type, allowing <em>any</em> of them, use comma separation (without
    spaces).</li>

    <li><strong>Any type, optional with default</strong> - To make an optional Prop, you
    must specify it's default value.  To specify a default value, repeat
    attribute with a <code>.default</code> suffix. If a default is specified,
    the component will no longer cause an error when it does not encounter a
    value, but instead use the default value.   If you don't expect to use the
    default value, but still want to make a prop optional nonetheless (e.g.
    perhaps  its usage is dependent on the value of another prop), consider
    setting the default value with <code>:=null</code>.</li>


    <li><strong>Type-checked, optional with default</strong> - Finally, by
    combining both type-checking with specifying default values, we can make
    Props that are both type-checked and optional.</li>
</ol>


<p>See below for an example of each of the 4 types of Props:</p>

<mws-Demo
text='
<!-- 1. Any type, required -->
<Props
    design
    data
></Props>

<!-- 2. Type-checked, required -->
<Props
    design=String
    data=Array
></Props>

<!-- 3. Any type, optional with default -->
<Props
    design
    design.default="square"
    data
    data.default:=&apos;[1, 2, 3]&apos;
></Props>

<!-- 4. Type-checked, optional with default -->
<Props
    design=String
    design.default="square"
    data=Array
    data.default:=&apos;[1, 2, 3]&apos;
></Props>
'></mws-Demo>


<mws-Section name="module">Module</mws-Section>

<p>The "module" CPart is a Factory CPart, much like Component. It behaves
exactly like Component, except it immediately initializes all of its containing
CParts, and will not attempt to mount itself anywhere on the page. It's purpose
is for "stashing" CParts for re-use within a component library file, or
configuring high-level aspects that are common to multiple Components within a
given component library file.</p>

<p>The <em>Module</em> CPart is the least frequently used. It enables
grouping together of any other CParts into a "global" component-like structure.
It's mostly useful for creating static behavior that goes at the top of a
library file and is shared by components within that file.</p>


<h3>Example usage</h3>


<mws-Demo
text='
<Module>
    <Script>
        // You can write utility functions to be reused
        function copyTextToClipboard(text) {
            navigator.clipboard.writeText(text);
        }

        // Or manually export static data
        script.exports.globalData = Array.from({ length: 100 });

        // The "module" can also be used to register custom CParts or extending
        // Modulo features, such as customizing the Templating Engine
        class MyCoolPart extends Modulo.ComponentPart { /* etc */ }
        Modulo.cparts.mycoolpart = MyCoolPart;

        class CustomTemplates extends Modulo.templating.MTL { /* etc */ }
        Modulo.templating.mycoolengine = CustomTemplates;
    </Script>
</Module>

<Component name="ExampleComponent">
    <!-- Custom engines defined above can then be referenced here -->
    <Template engine="mycoolengine">
        <p>hello world</p>
    </Template>

    <Script>
        // Functions defined above are available here:
        module.script.copyTextToClipboard("hey there!")

        // All "module" exports are available here:
        console.log("global data:", module.script.exports.globalData);
    </Script>

    <!-- And custom registered CParts can be used here as well -->
    <mycoolpart
        does="nothing yet"
    ></mycoolpart>

</Component>
