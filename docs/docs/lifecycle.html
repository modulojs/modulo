<h1>Lifecycle</h1>

<p>Every Modulo Component goes through a certain "lifecycle". Here's an
analogy: If CParts are the stage-hands and actors who put on a play, then the
"lifecycle" is the pre-described arrangement of each "act", intermission, and
so on, such that every CPart stage-hand "jumps in" at the right moment to do
it's job and set up for the next act.</p>

<mws-section name="global">Global lifecycle</mws-section>

<p>Every <em>Component</em> that you define triggers a certain set of lifecycle
phases. The lifecycle phases that a Modulo <em>Component</em> progresses
through can be categorized into a few groups. One way to think of these phases
is that typically, the "output" of a previous lifecycle phase in a group is the
"input" of the next phase. As an example, <code>prebuild</code> generates a
flat, serializable structure that <code>define</code> uses to instantiate more
complicated JavaScript instances.  Similarly, <code>prepare</code> figures out
the template variables, <code>render</code> causes the template to actually
perform the render based on the variables in the previous phase, and
<code>update</code> updates the HTML of the element based on the rendered
output of the previous phase.</p>


<h3>Global Modulo lifecycle phases</h3>

<p>These phases happen <em>once per CPart definition</em>. These will happen
even if the component is never used or instantiated anywhere, but only defined
and loaded. They are intended for setting up the component "definition" (data
structure blueprint for component instances).</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>prebuild</code> - A stage for prebuild processing of data. This
    is for static analysis and similar pre-processing. Note that if Modulo
    components are built or cached, or if they are ever pre-compiled into a
    single JS file, this <code>prebuild</code> phase happens BEFORE saving, and
    thus gets "baked-in".  This means that the results of a
    <code>prebuild</code> phase must be "serializable", such as in a JSON
    format.  Note that this happens after <code>confPreprocessors</code>,
    meaning it will already have things like <code>-src=</code> resolved for
    you. This is also when you want to define any assets for the asset manager,
    such as JS functions or CSS.</li>

    <li><code>define</code> - Use this to actually define and register
    Components, or run global script tags. This happens after the
    <code>prebuild</code>, but before the component is used.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> "Modulo lifecycle phases" are only accessible to
<em>CPart</em> developers, and <em>not</em> accessible to component developers
using script tags.</p>

<h3>Component lifecycle phases: Factory</h3>

<p>The factory phase happen <em>once per Component definition</em>. It will
happen even if the component is never used or instantiated anywhere, but only
defined. This <code>factory</code> thus happens during the <code>define</code>
global phase of Modulo, and is invoked to prepare the Component definition.</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>factory</code> - Happens while a component is getting defined.
    This happens after the <code>prebuild</code> and <code>define</code> phases,
    but before the component is used.  Unlike the <code>prebuild</code> and
    <code>define</code> phases, <code>factory</code> happens after the page
    loads, and thus has no restrictions on what it does or generate. (E.g. it's
    output does <em>not</em> need to be serializeable, since it will be run
    after built JS files as well).</li>
</ul>


<mws-section name="component">Component lifecycle</mws-section>

<h3>Construction and initialization lifecycle</h3>

<p>Two methods are triggered when a component is mounted on the
page:</p>
<ul>
    <li><em>constructor()</em> - While technically not a lifecycle method, the
    constructor() method will be invoked when creating an instance of the CPart
    class. This happens <em>before</em> the Component's HTML Element is
    guaranteed to be fully loaded on the DOM.</li>
    <li><code>initialized</code> - Happens once per instance, every time a
    component is fully mounted (i.e. used) on a page, but before the first
    render. Useful for fetching or setting up initial data on a component, as
    all the component will be fully ready for use at this point. Note that this
    will only be invoked after the initial DOM is fully loaded, but before the
    <em>prepare</em> of the first rerender (described below).</li>
</ul>


<h3>Rendering lifecycle</h3>

<p>All of 4 these lifecycle phases trigger in the following sequence every time
a component renders. This including the first time, every manual rerender (e.g.
invoking <code>element.rerender()</code>), and ever automatic rerender (e.g.
after events or state manipulation). These will phases even trigger if you
don't have a <em>Template</em> CPart defined (although without a
<em>Template</em> there will be nothing to render, <em>per se</em>).</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>prepare</code> - Gather data needed before rendering (e.g. gather
    variables for template). Return values from here to have "computed
    variables" within the Template and Script code.</li>
    <li><code>render</code> - The Template CPart will use this phase to to
    render HTML code from the template specified
    (by setting <code>renderObj.component.innerHTML</code></li>
    <li><code>reconcile</code> - The Component CPart will compare the new
    rendered HTML to the DOM, and generates a "patch-set" or array of
    operations necessary to reconcile the DOM to the new HTML (by setting
    <code>renderObj.component.patches</code>)</li>
    <li><code>update</code> - Finally, the Component will apply the patch-set
    generated in the previous step, actually modifying the DOM and invoking any
    directive callbacks specified</li>
</ul>


<h3>Directives that invoke lifecycle methods</h3>

<p>Directives can can cause lifecycle phases as well. With the built-in CParts,
there is only one directive that will trigger any lifecycle phases: The
<code>event</code> directive (e.g. <code>@click</code>).  More information on
directives is <a href="/docs/directives.html">covered in the Directives
section</a>. </p>

<ul>
    <li><code>event</code> - Triggers when an event is about to happen.</li>
    <li><code>eventCleanup</code> - Triggers after an event happened. A common
    pattern is to use this and the previous to figure out what has "changed"
    due to the event, and respond accordingly.</li>
</ul>


<!--
<mws-Section name="factory">Mechanics of <em>factory</em> lifecycle</mws-Section>

<p>The "factory" lifecycle behaves slightly differently. Most lifecycle methods
can be invoked by using the <code>lifecycle</code> method of
<code>ModuloElement</code>, e.g.  <code>element.lifecycle('prepare')</code>.
The "factory" lifecycle, however, is run with <code>runFactoryLifecycle</code>,
a method of <code>ComponentFactory</code>, before any components or actual
elements are created.</p>

<p>The is a special lifecycle for any global or one-time setup, after component
definitions are loaded, but before before any components are constructed.
Examples: the Style CPart uses this stage to set up global CSS, the Template
CPart uses this to compile the template and include it in a script tag in the
head, and the Script CPart will actually wrap the script-tag and include into
the head.</p>

<p>Like every other "lifecycle" in Modulo, it passes around a "renderObj"
called baseRenderObj. After this method, this baseRenderObj is not modified,
but instead gets copied into every other renderObj to form, as the name
implies, the "base" of future renderObj.</p>

<p>In total, the <code>runFactoryLifecycle(cPartOpts)</code> method of
<code>ComponentFactory</code> loops through all the CPart names, finding
each relevant CPart Classes, and then invoking each CPart static method
<code>factoryCallback</code>, which is what does the necessary preprocessing.
If there are multiples of the same CPart, then whichever appears last will
overwrite and/or merge data with the previous ones.  However, that particular
behavior can be controlled from within each CPart factoryCallback itself.</p>
-->


<mws-section name="callbacks">Lifecycle Callbacks</mws-section>

<p>The purpose of <em>lifecycle phases</em> is the <em>lifecycle methods</em>
or callback functions that "hook into" each phase and run during them.</p>

<p>You can get the name for a <em>lifecycle method</em> by simply suffixing the
name of the phase with the word <code>Callback</code>. For example,
<code>prepare</code> thus becomes
<code>function&nbsp;prepareCallback()&nbsp;{...</code>.  Every CPart has the
ability to hook into lifecycle methods by defining a method with an expected
name. This is useful for CPart developers to implement the actual behavior and
functionality of a CPart. In fact, most of CPart code is just hooking into
these different methods!</p>

<p>The <em>Script</em> CPart also exposes this interface to component
developers. This is so that you can write custom code in each component to
execute during any one of the phases. Note that you cannot hook into the global
phases (e.g., prebuild, define, factory) this way, since those need to happen
before your script tag is even ready.</p>

<p>Directives also have callback functions, <a href="/docs/directives.html">covered in a
the directive section</a>.</p>

<a name="renderobj"></a>
<h3>renderObj</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>renderObj is like "req" </strong> -
<code>renderObj</code> is comparable to the "request" or "response" objects
in many backend MVC frameworks, such as in Express.js or Django. In these,
middleware works behind the scenes to modify or construct the "request" object.
They prepare it for the controller functions that accept it as an argument, by
attaching data and injecting dependencies.  For a concrete example, enabling
Express's JSON parsing middleware adds the <code>req.json</code> attribute to
request objects, for parsing of JSON data.</p>
<p>This is what inspired the <code>renderObj</code>, which is a plain object
that gets passed along throughout the lifecycle phases. The Component Parts act
just like middleware in other web frameworks: Work together to construct the
<code>renderObj</code> for users of the framework.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So far in this document, we covered how lifecycle methods are central to
CParts, and that CParts are central to Modulo components in general.
Now, we will learn how <code>renderObj</code> is central to lifecycle methods.
It's how lifecycle methods pass data and communicate, as a component passes
through the different phases.</p>


<h3>renderObj and lifecycle</h3>

<p>The renderObj goes through 3 phases. The first is during set-up, the second
during component factory initialization, and the third happens every time a
component rerenders.</p>

<ol>
    <li><code>loadObj</code> - This is the version created during the
    <code>load</code> phase, and is typically just the text and attributes of
    the component definition with any pre-processing done. Unlike the other
    objects, <code>loadObj</code> <em>can only</em> contain plain or
    JSON-friendly data types.</li>

    <li><code>baseRenderObj</code> - The <code>loadObj</code> is copied to the
    <code>baseRenderObj</code>, which is the result of the <code>factory</code>
    phase. This might have more dependencies injected, e.g. the template CPart
    at this point will have compiled the template code a JS function.</li>

    <li><code>renderObj</code> - This is the one that component developers are
    more likely to encounter. During first render, and every time a
    <code>.rerender()</code> method is called, <code>renderObj</code> is
    duplicated from the <code>baseRenderObj</code>, and then gets passed around
    through the <code>prepare</code>, <code>render</code>, <code>reconcile</code>,
    and <code>update</code> phases.</li>
</ol>




<p>Typically, unless developing new CParts, you will have little need to
directly interact with the <code>renderObj</code>. You already implicitly use
it in several cases. For example,
whenever you access variables in the <em>Script</em> CPart, the
<code>state</code> variable is in fact shorthand for
<code>element.renderObj.state</code>, or whenever you access <a href="http://icheb.local:8080/docs/templating.html#variables">variables in the
template</a> <em>CPart</em> (e.g., <code>props.text</code> is
shorthand for <code>element.renderObj.props.text</code>).
So, if you are a component developer and not a CPart developer, and you find
yourself thinking that it doesn't make a lot of sense why you'd need to access
or modify the <code>renderObj</code> explicitly... You probably don't!</p>

<p>Nevertheless, use the following example to examine the output of the
following example to see what information is available or modified at each
step:</p>


<mws-demo demotype="minipreview" text="
<Template>
<label>
<input [state.bind] name=&quot;enabled&quot; type=&quot;checkbox&quot; />
Show messages in console</label>
</Template>

<State
    enabled:=false
></State>

<Script>
    function _logInfo(message, renderObj) {
        // Little helper function to do messages in console
        if (state.enabled) {
            const formattedOutput = JSON.stringify(renderObj, null, 2);
            console.log(message, formattedOutput);
        }
    }

    function prepareCallback(renderObj) {
        _logInfo(&quot;prepareCallback:&quot;,  renderObj);
    }

    function renderCallback(renderObj) {
        _logInfo(&quot;renderCallback:&quot;, renderObj);
    }

    function reconcileCallback(renderObj) {
        _logInfo(&quot;reconcileCallback:&quot;, renderObj);
    }

    function updateCallback(renderObj) {
        _logInfo(&quot;updateCallback:&quot;, renderObj);
    }
