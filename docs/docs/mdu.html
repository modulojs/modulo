<h1>MDU: Modulo Developer Utilities</h1>

<h3>What is "MDU"?</h3>

<p>When the letters <code>olo</code> of "Modulo" are rearranged into a
<code>%</code> symbol, the remaining letters are <code>mdu</code>. This can be
backformed then into an acronym: Modulo Developer Utilities—or, if you
prefer, it can be "Modulo Developer <em>Universe</em>", to make the acronym
similar to that of a popular movie franchise. Obviously none of this was
planned, but given that naming things is one of the (tongue-in-cheek)
<em>hardest problems in computer science</em>, this naive solution should be
sufficient. Take that, hardest problem!</p>

<p>There are several goals of the MDU project. The first is to develop a
command-line utility (as <code>modulocli</code>) to aid in Modulo development.
This consists of tools developed while developing Modulo and it's
documentation. This will also consist of examples showing how Modulo can be
used as a JAMStack-style SSG, and (eventually) a full-stack, database based
multi-page app.</p>

<p>The second goal is to develop a standard library of useful components (as
the <em>MDU Component Library</em>). This will include common widgets (e.g.
Buttons, Dropdowns, Modals, and the like) with a bare-bones (but theme-able)
appearance. The goal of these common widgets is to both provide example code
for Modulo best practices, and also be useful for rapid-prototyping, with the
assumption that eventually they will be swapped out for something more
sophisticated or fine-tuned. This website will then be rewritten to be built
only with these components. In addition to common widgets, there is a plan to
develop a full set of widgets for "story-book" style documentation. This will
be used for both this documentation, but also allow for easily launching your
own well-documented component libraries, and thus providing a standard
structure for Modulo component library documentation in general.</p>

<p>The third goal is similar to the second, but instead of full components,
it's to develop a standard library of more <em>CParts</em>. The intention here
is to keep Modulo.js itself to only to core behavior, while still showing off
more functionality. These extra CParts should make easier to avoid using
<em>Script</em> tags: The plan is to include <em>CParts</em> that allow for
easier integration with APIs (e.g. a "fetch" CPart for hooking REST and/or
GraphQL APIs directly to state) and legacy code (e.g. a "jQuery" CPart that
will make it easier to embed old jQuery plug-ins as though they were Modulo
components).</p>

<p>Of the 3 goals, only <code>modulocli</code> and the <em>TestSuite</em> CPart
(which may get included later, in some reduced form, in Modulo.js base) have
any documentation.  <strong>The documentation below is on experimental features
for Modulo.  Experimental features may have incomplete documentation or an API
that might change drastically in the future.</strong></p>



<mws-section modulo-original-html="modulocli">
        <a class="secanchor" title="Click to focus on this section." id="" name="" href="#">#</a>
        <h2>modulocli</h2>
    </mws-section>

<p>Modulo CLI allows you to use Modulo Console Commands in a regular
command-line interface. It is included in the repo and will soon be installable
via npm.</p>


<pre>Usage:   modulocli CMD [preload(s)] [--flag(s)]
</pre>

<pre>Example: modulocli ssg --input ./src/ --output ./public/
</pre>

<h3>Available sub-commands:</h3>
<ul>
     <li><strong>build</strong> - Builds your Modulo project as a single JS
     file.</li>

     <li><strong>buildpreload</strong> - Builds a "preload" file, defaulting to
     "m.js", to pre-pack layouts and allow for easier development of static
     sites without needing to "load" everything each time. Note that this is
     also done automatically when you do a <code>ssg</code> build.</li>

     <li><strong>generate</strong> - Does the SSG "generate" step on a single,
     specified file. Useful for debugging SSG behavior, but rarely useful
     outside of that.</li>

     <li><strong>help</strong> - Shows help</li>

     <li><strong>serve</strong> - Runs the SSG, and starts an express server on
     the resulting directory, while watching for changes. By default, it will
     also serve up the source on a separate PORT. If <code>serverAppPath</code>
     is specified, it can also run an arbitrary backend Express
     application, allowing for full-stack development.</li>

     <li><strong>servesrc</strong> - Like "serve", except only for the source
     directory</li>


     <li><strong>shell</strong> - Begins an interactive Node.js REPL shell that
     allows for Modulo Console Commands (just like in the browser console),
     useful for interactive debugging</li>

     <li><strong>ssg</strong> - The main SSG command: Copies from the input
     directory into the output directory, pre-rendering any Modulo components
     that it finds in HTML files.</li>

     <li><strong>target</strong> - (Incomplete) - Used for targeting components
     for introspection while debugging, especially useful in conjunction with
     "shell".</li>

     <li><strong>test</strong> - Runs all test-suites associated with loaded
     components.</li>

     <li><strong>watch</strong> - Similar to "SSG", except it will use
     <code>node-watch</code> to watch for changes in the input directory, and
     rerun the SSG if anything changes.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Available flags:</h3>

<h4>How to configure</h4>
<p>All below settings can be specified in one of 3 places:</p>
<ol>
    <li> ./modulo.json    (this path can be changed with <code>MODULO_CONF</code> env var)</li>
    <li> ./package.json   (will look under a "modulo" key)</li>
    <li> As a CLI flag    (using below "--ouput=/docs" style syntax)</li>
</ol>
<p>For the greatest control, specify a JSON file (1 or 2)</p>


<h4>Full list of configuration flags</h4>
<ul>
    <li><code>--help=false</code>
         [alias: -h] Show this online help text (same as "help" command)
    </li>

    <li><code>--verbose=false</code>
         [alias: -v] Produce noisier logging output for debugging
    </li>

    <li><code>--host=127.0.0.1</code>
         [alias: -a] For modulo server: Specifies address to bind
    </li>

    <li><code>--port=3333</code>
         [alias: -p] For modulo server: Specifies port to bind
    </li>

    <li><code>--input=srcwww</code>
         Specifies input directory for static site, which will be copied 1:1
         and transformed into output
    </li>

    <li><code>--output=www</code>
         Specifies output directory for static site. This directory
         is the one that should be served up as your site (e.g. for sites
         hosted on GitHub Pages, this should be "docs").
    </li>

    <li><code>--buildOutput=./modulo-build-{{versiondate}}-{{hash}}.js</code>
         Use this to specify the path of the BUILD JS bundle output during
         the SSG step. This file will contain the Modulo source code, all of
         your components, preloads, and any extra bundled JS files. Also,
         during the postprocessing step, each GENERATE'd page will be
         revisited and get a script-tag inserted with the path to this file.
         This path gets templated using MTL syntax and the following
         variables available:
         input, output (the same as config)
         versiondate (an Ubuntu-esque version number, e.g. 1.10 for a release
                      in the 10th month of 2021)
         hash        (the hash uniquely identifying the new build)
    </li>


    <li><code>--buildPreload={{input}}/m.js</code>
         The path to the preload build. This typically should go into your
         input directory, being the only thing to do so. The default is to
         name it "/m.js", thus facilitating a very short script tag in your
         input files. All preloaded files (along with their dependencies)
         will be built into this file.
    </li>

    <li><code>--serverApp=null</code>
         If you are building a JAMstack-style app, you can use point this
         path to the file that sets up your backend routes. You can already
         get this behavior by simply placing a file in "srv/index.js" that
         exports an Express.js-like "app". When you run "modulocli serve", it
         will find this file, require it, and then use whatever exported as
         the server that Modulo attaches it's own middleware to.
    </li>

    <li><code>--serverAppPath=srv/index.js</code>
         This is the default value of serverApp if not specified, and
         changing this behaves the same way with one exception: If it's not
         found, it will simply warn (in verbose mode) and move on. 
         Typically this is not changed (instead you should change serverApp).
    </li>

    <li><code>--serverFramework=express</code>
         Specify a package to be "required" to host the server. If you change
         this from "express", the interface of this package should be
         generally Express.js-like. Typically not changed, but could be
         useful for upgrading to alternate packages, or specifying a local
         path to allow middleware or patching.
    </li>

    <li><code>--serverAutoFixSlashes=false</code>
         Set to true to automatically attach "/" to requests that need it
         (e.g. requesting "/site/news", where "news" is a directory, might
         turn into "/site/news/" and thus "/site/news/index.html".) Note that
         this setting ONLY affects the server, it will not affect the SSG
         output, which will never attempt to fix this or alter paths.
    </li>

    <li><code>--serverAutoFixExtensions=true</code>
         Set to true to automatically attach ".html" to requests that need
         it, allowing you to skip the .html ending in your links. Note that
         this setting ONLY affects the server, it will not affect the SSG
         output, which will always attach .html endings. If you want to hide
         .html endings for an static-deployed site, you will need to
         configure this with your static host. Many hosts support this,
         in fact GitHub Pages does this automatically already, so no
         configuration necessary there.
    </li>

    <li><code>--ssgRenderDepth=10</code>
         During the SSG step, this important setting specifies how many times
         GENERATE will rerender, discovering and attaching Modulo components,
         before deciding that the page is "good enough" and copying over the
         results. How many steps do you need? Each time a component renders a
         subcomponent, or renders in an unpredictable manner (e.g. produces
         random output), Modulo will need to do another rendering step, since
         it will keep on rendering until the HTML "stabilizes". Thus, if you
         expect many nested components, you should set this to a high number.
         The purpose of this limit is to prevent infinite recursion caused by
         non-deterministic components. However, you should still avoid
         non-deterministic components for other reasons.
    </li>

    <li><code>--ssgBuildOutput={{output}}/js/modulo-build-{{versiondate}}-{{hash}}.js</code>
         Use this to specify the path of the BUILD JS bundle output during
         the SSG step. This file will contain the Modulo source code, all of
         your components, preloads, and any extra bundled JS files. Also,
         during the postprocessing step, each GENERATE'd page will be
         revisited and get a script-tag inserted with the path to this file.
         As with other BUILD paths, this path gets templated using MTL syntax
         with the same variables available (see buildPath)
    </li>

    <li><code>--testAllowPreload=false</code>
         The "test" command is the only one which will NOT automatically
         preload before running, in order to save time and keep tests better
         isolated. Enable this if your test-suites need the preloads.
    </li>

    <li><code>--testLog=false</code>
         Enable the test log file will keep track of the maximum number of
         assertions that pass and fail when running. If enabled, an OMISSION
         FAILURE will occur if the number of assertions ever goes down. This
         is to ensure that no regressions get introduced which cause tests to
         not even be "picked up" or fail silently (e.g. Regressions during
         CPart load-steps can cause tests to not even load).
    </li>

    <li><code>--testLogPath=.modulo.testlog.json</code>
         Specify the desired file path of your test log file. Do not ignore
         this file in VCS: Share when collaborating to "lock in" test count.
    </li>

    <li><code>--isSkip=^(\\.|_)</code>
         For SSG, specify a RegExp string that is tested against every "path
         part", or each directory or filename that make up a file path. If
         any path part matches this, it will skip that path and everything
         under it.  The default behavior is to ignore dot-prefixed and
         underscore-prefixed hidden files. Since most OS's do not treat
         underscore-prefixed files to be hidden, this is a handy way to get
         the SSG to skip a directory, without it being fully hidden.
    </li>

    <li><code>--isCopyOnly=^components?$</code>
         For SSG, specify a RegExp string that is tested against every "path
         part", or each directory or filename that make up a file path. If
         any path part matches this, it will refuse to apply the GENERATE
         action (i.e.  prerender the file as an Modulo HTML file), even if it
         otherwise would have. You should set this to match whatever
         directory (or directories) contain your component files, so it
         doesn't attempt to "prerender" the component definitions, which
         might be fine, but more likely will lead to unexpected results.
    </li>

    <li><code>--isGenerate=.*\\.html$</code>
         For SSG, specify a RegExp string that is tested against each file's
         entire path (e.g. the $ is the end of the full path).
    </li>

    <li><code>--preload=[]</code>
         For modulo.json (or package.json) configurations, this specifies
         extra preloaded HTML files (like positional arguments on the CLI).
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Test suites</h3>

<p>Modulo comes with a unit testing framework, specifically for testing
components. Note that without any extra add-ons or modifications, Modulo's
testing framework is focused on components unit tests only, and thus is
strictly synchronous. This means its incapable of integration testing with HTTP
API's, or asynchronous code. That said, through proper mocking, state, and
props manipulation, you should be more than equipped to test component behavior
in most scenarios, without actually issuing the request itself.</p>

<p>A test suite is a collection of tests. Test suites can be embedded in
Component definitions. In this case, the test suite will be applied to the
component definition that it exists inside.</p>

<p>For an overview of what the Modulo test suite framework is capable of, see
the below example:</p>

<mws-demo text="
<testsuite>
    <test name=&quot;ensure fine&quot;>
        <!-- SETUP -->
        <!-- Using Props and State we can setup the component for testing -->
        <Props text=&quot;Hi&quot;></Props>
        <State
            search=&quot;the lord of the rings&quot;
            loading:=true
        ></State>

        <!-- ASSERTIONS -->
        <!-- run arbitrary scripts, if ends in &quot;assert: &quot; it will then be a test -->
        <!-- If the assertion fails, the test runner will attempt to expose the
            values of any variable in the &quot;assert:&quot; line. For better debugging,
            keep the &quot;assert:&quot; line one simple expression with variables -->
        <Script name=&quot;ensure no longer loading&quot;>
            const words = state.search.split(&quot; &quot;);
            const firstWord = words[0];
            assert: firstWord === &quot;the&quot;
        </Script>

        <!-- Style lets us test CSS. Here we ensure all li elements are blue
            (no matter how they were colored that way, e.g. even if inline or
            inherited) -->
        <!-- TODO: Not implemented yet -->
        <Style name=&quot;blue is cool&quot;>
            li { color: blue; }
        </Style>

        <!-- Most powerful assertion of all, the Template: Check if the
             contents of the component match the given DOM. This compares as DOM
             (not string), so excess whitespace, etc is ignored.
        -->
        <Template>
            <p>Hello 3 world!</p>
            <h1>I have 5 bananas</h1>
