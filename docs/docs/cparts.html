<h1>CParts</h1>


<blockquote>
<p><strong>Custom CParts?</strong> Here we describe core CParts used by
component developers, which are sufficient for most common use-cases.  However,
if you are instead looking to extend this core functionality with custom CParts
written in JavaScript, refer to the <a href="/demos/#experiments">Custom
Component Part examples on the demos page</a>, at least until more thorough
CPart API documentation is developed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The central concept to Modulo is that of <em>Component Parts</em>. Because
it is so central, saying <em>Component Parts</em> over and over gets tiresome,
so in this documentation it will be typically shortened to <em>CParts</em>.
Every component definition consists of configuring one or more CPart
definitions. Modulo comes "batteries-included" with about 8 CParts, which
provide the core functionality of building Modulo Components, and are
documented here.</p>

<p>Conventionally, when defining components, CParts are listed in the following
order within a given <em>Component</em> definition:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Props</li>
    <li>Template</li>
    <li><em>(Any other CParts)</em></li>
    <li>State</li>
    <li>StaticData</li>
    <li>Script</li>
    <li>Style</li>
</ol>

<p>The rationale for this ordering is to put <em>Props</em> and
<em>Template</em> first since they are often the first CParts that are
important to read when trying to understand or debug the behavior of a
<em>Component</em>, while putting <em>Style</em> last as it's typically the
least important to read. Note that ordering makes a difference: They will be
processed in the order given.</p>

<p>Typically, you will not need to have more than one of the same type of CPart
in a given component.  However, in some cases for particular CParts it might
make sense, such as to mix in multiple <em>Styles</em> into a single
<em>Component</em>.  In the case of duplicate CParts of the same type, often
the behavior is that "whoever gets the last word in wins", or the configuration
specified by the final CPart takes precedence (although this depends on the
CPart in question).</p>



<mws-section name="component" modulo-original-html="Component">
        <a class="secanchor" title="Click to focus on this section." id="component" name="component" href="#component">#</a>
        <h2>Component</h2>
    </mws-section>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Low-level interface</strong> - Component developers will typically
only need to use the <code>name="..."</code> attribute on <em>Component</em>,
and sometimes <code>mode="vanish-into-document"</code> for  page-level
components. Similarly, none of the <code>renderObj.component</code> properties
are typically useful for component developers. Instead, they are used
internally by CParts (notably <em>Template</em>) in order to move along the
rendering cycle.</p> </blockquote>

<p>The <em>Component</em> CPart is the most central to Modulo. It's how we
register components to be mounted on the page, and define the other CParts that
go inside those Components. It's also what stitches together the "machinery"
that makes reconciliation and rendering even possible. In other words, the
<em>Component</em> CPart is what handles the "low-level" operations of
mounting, reconciling to generate patches, and applying those patches to
rerender, and the interface described here allows for low-level manipulation of
this process for unusual circumstances when it's needed.</p>


<h3>renderObj</h3>

<p>The Component CPart reads several properties from the
<code>renderObj</code>, at different lifecycle phases. Read below on how to
interface with it.</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>component.originalHTML</code> - <strong>Read-only</strong> -
    This contains the initial HTML that the element had when mounted on the
    page.</li>

    <li><code>component.innerHTML</code> - <strong>Write-only</strong> -
    Assign to this to cause the <em>Component</em> CPart to attempt to
    reconcile the current HTML with the target HTML provided.
    It functions a little bit like HTML's built-in <em>"element.innerHTML"</em>:
    Assign a string containing HTML code to this property to see the HTML
    appear on the page. This is what the <em>Template</em> CPart does behind
    the scenes. Unlike HTML's built-in <em>"element.innerHTML"</em>, assigning
    to this renderObj property will not cause an full update, overwriting
    everything that exists, but instead will cause the <em>Component</em> to
    employ the "reconciler" specified to generate a patches list (see next). By
    default, it will then also apply those patches in the <code>update</code>
    lifecycle.</li>

    <li><code>component.patches</code> - Between the <code>reconcile</code> and
    <code>update</code> stages, the "patches" property is exposed to allow
    access to or modification of the patches that the Component intends to
    apply. This is an advanced feature that gives fine-grained control to how
    rendering works, and thus is only useful in rare situations where that
    control is needed. For example, you could use this property to "intercept"
    the patches that are about to be applied to your component while
    re-rendering, and, for an example, forbid the removal of attributes by
    deleting all patches with <em>"removeAttribute"</em>. This is in the format
    of an Array. Each item in the Array is itself a 4-Array (Array of length
    4), in the following format: <code>[element, method, arg1, arg2]</code>.
    For example, to do a <em>"removeAttribute"</em> patch on an "id" attribute
    for a given "target element" (a real DOM node on the page somewhere), it
    might be
<code>[(ref&nbsp;to&nbsp;"target element"),&nbsp;"removeAttribute",&nbsp;"id",&nbsp;undefined]</code>
If the Array is empty, then no patches will be applied.
    </li>
</ul>


<h3>attrs</h3>

<p>Components CParts use their attributes to set several configuration options.
They take the following attributes:</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>name</code> - <em>REQUIRED</em> - The "name" of the component.
    Conventionally, it should be written in camel or dromedary case, like
    how class names are written in JavaScript: <code>LikeThis</code>.
    Technically, it's case insensitive, so a component named like
    <code>LikeThis</code>, imported with an <code>x-</code> namespace, could
    also be used like <code>x-likethis</code> or <code>X-LIKETHIS</code>.</li>

    <li><code>engine</code> - <em>default is <code>engine="ModRec"</code></em> -
    The Reconciler Engine selected. By default, ModRec, the built-in Modulo
    Reconciler engine, is enabled. If you want to experiment with other
    reconciliation engines, such as ones that might be faster or take into
    account unusual scenarios, set this equal to another property of
    <code>Modulo.reconcilers</code>.</li>

    <li><code>rerender</code> - <em>default is
    <code>rerender="event"</code></em>.  Specify mode to change the render mode
    of this component.  A detailed discussion of valid options are below:
        <ul>
            <li><code>rerender="event"</code> - The default behavior, where the
            the component will rerender after ever event it handles (e.g. after
            every user interaction). This is typically desirable since usually
            every user interaction will cause some visual change that needs to
            be reflected.</li>

            <li><code>rerender="manual"</code> - Modulo will not auto-rerender
            in any situation. This
            Note that if this is set, you will have to manually rerender, such
            as in a <em>Script</em> CPart (<code>element.rerender()</code>), or
            in a custom CPart (<code>this.element.rerender()</code>) is
            invoked. This is useful if there are many events that don't cause
            changes (e.g. mouse movement), but you have discovered that the
            extra rerender invocations are impacting performance, even though
            they aren't generating patches to modify the DOM.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li><code>mode</code> - <em>default is <code>mode="regular"</code></em>.
    Specify mode to change the DOM root render mode of this component. This
    changes what is considered to be the root of the element, and thus where
    the content of the Template goes during reconciliation. In "regular" and
    "vanish", it's the custom component itself (which will be removed after
    rendering with "vanish"), in "shadow", it uses an attached shadow DOM as
    the root, and with "vanish-into-document" it replaces the entire page.
    This allows you to isolate outside CSS from your component using "shadow",
    do one-time renders only with "vanish", or make your component replace the
    entire document with "vanish-into-document". A detailed discussion of valid
    options are below:
        <ul>
            <li><code>mode="regular"</code> - The default behavior, where the
            content generated by this the element will be attached to the
            regular DOM, as the element itself. This means that CSS stylesheets
            attached the normal way (e.g. with a "link" tag) will affect the
            contents of this component. <em>Style</em> CParts are, however,
            automatically scoped to the component, so a selector like
            <code>p&nbsp;{...}</code> will get prefixed like
            <code>x-MyComp&nbsp;p&nbsp;{...}</code> when CSS files are being
            generated from <em>Style</em> CParts. Keep in mind the normal CSS
            rules will still apply, meaning that auto-scoped "p" tag will also
            affect children, grandchildren, etc of sub-components (unless those
            are "shadow" based).</li>

            <li><code>mode="shadow"</code> - Use the so-called "shadow DOM" to
            render the content generated by this component. While the
            <em>shadow DOM</em> may sound like a sci-fi villain, it's a
            mechanism browsers provide for custom elements to isolate their
            contents from CSS selectors or other JavaScript libraries. This
            isolation means means that CSS stylesheets attached the normal way
            (e.g. with a "link" tag) <em>will not</em> affect the contents of
            this element. Note that other than the isolation provided, the
            shadow mode should work exactly the same as regular. That said,
            <em>Style</em> CParts will still be automatically scoped to the
            component, but will use the shadowDOM feature to more strictly
            enforce that scoping. Note that shadowDOM CSS will <em>not</em> get
            included in the CSS file bundle, but instead will be bundled in the
            JavaScript source code. For a component by itself, switching from
            "shadow" to "regular" or vice-versa shouldn't change behavior at
            all. It's only useful when CSS from one component or a third party
            CSS library is "getting inside" your other components in an
            undesirable way, and you want to isolate them.</li>

            <li><code>mode="vanish"</code> - This less-used setting causes the
            component to "vanish" after rendering, or replace itself with it's
            children. Setting this will cause the component to remove itself
            after the first time it renders, effectively using the component as
            a simple template. All CParts will become useless after the first
            rendering, so CParts like <em>Script</em> or <em>State</em> are
            rarely useful in combination with this mode. This "one-time render"
            feature is most useful for static pages when you don't want your
            custom components to get in the way of the DOM that is generated,
            and for creating static-site generators, when you just want to
            generate plain HTML, with no Modulo JS or behavior in the end.</li>

            <li><code>mode="vanish-into-document"</code> - This setting is
            useful in one situation: When you want to create a "page" level
            component that changes tags that belong in the document head, such
            as <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>. Like with <code>mode="vanish"</code>
            described above, setting this will cause the component to remove
            itself after the first time it renders. However, with
            vanish-into-document, it will instead replace the entire page.
            It will also attempt to correctly insert all tags that belong in
            the document head (meta, title, link, script to be specific),
            causing link and script tags alike (e.g.
            <code>&lt;script src=".."&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>) to load.
            Finally, the document will be wiped, and anything else it finds
            will be put directly into the document's body, for a clean DOM
            structure that removes itself entirely during this "one-time
            render".</li>

            <li><code>mode="custom-root"</code> - This is rarely useful, but
            allows for setting some other DOM element as the new root element
            for the component to target for rendering it's content. This is
            done by assigning a value to <code>renderObj.component.root</code>
            before reconciliation. If no <code>.root</code> value is set, an
            error will occur.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>


<h3>Directives</h3>

<p>The <em>Component</em> CPart defines 3 directives:</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>[component.event]</code> (<em>shortcut:</em> <code>@</code>) -
    Attach event listeners to DOM elements, and remove them when the DOM
    elements are removed. (For jQuery users, this is used for similar purposes
    as "live" (delegated) events, but is faster.)</li>

    <li><code>[component.dataProp]</code> (<em>shortcut:</em> <code>:</code>) -
    Attach data to a DOM element's <code>.dataProp</code> object, which can be
    used to directly pass <code>renderObj</code> values as <em>Props</em> or
    events</li>

    <li><code>[component.slot]</code> - Reattach the original child elements
    that this component had when it was first mounted to a new DOM element.
    (For React users, this is similar to doing
    <code>{this.props.children}</code>.) This can be used in addition to or
    instead of the <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code> interface. For more on the slot
    interface, see Mozilla's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/slot">"The
    Web Component Slot element"</a>.  Note that Modulo uses this interface for
    both <code>mode="shadow"</code> (e.g. using <code>shadowRoot</code> as the
    root element for reconciliation) and all the other DOM rendering modes
    (e.g. <code>mode="regular"</code>,
    <code>mode="vanish-into-document"</code>). For Shadow DOM, it will
    fall-back on Browser behavior. For everything else, it will detach any
    nodes it finds and reattach the nodes just before the beginning of the
    reconciliation process (it's DOM load-directive).</li>
</ul>


<mws-section name="props" modulo-original-html="Props">
        <a class="secanchor" title="Click to focus on this section." id="props" name="props" href="#props">#</a>
        <h2>Props</h2>
    </mws-section>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Read-only</strong> Props are read-only within a component, and only
be set by the parent component. If the values change, the component re-renders
with the new values. They are only supposed to be information being <em>passed
to</em> the component, which means they can't be changed internally.  For
internal, mutable data, use <a href="#state">State</a> instead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Props allow components to receive data. You can think of Props as being like
"function parameters": They allow you to pass down "arguments" (attributes) to
component which can then modify it's appearance, behavior, or content based on
the values of these parameters. For more discussion of Props, see
<a href="/docs/tutorial_part2.html#props">Tutorial Part 2</a>.</p>

<p>Props are set by the parent component (or HTML page).  For String values,
use plain attributes (e.g. <code>&lt;x-Btn design="round"&gt;</code>).  For any
non-String types, you can use <em>data props</em> set using a <code>:=</code>
directive syntax for (e.g.
<code>&lt;x-Chart data:='[1, 2, 3]'&gt;</code>).</p>



<h3>renderObj</h3>

<p>Props contributes it's received values to the renderObj. Examples:</p><p>

</p><ol>
    <li>Prop set like: <code>&lt;x-Btn design="round"&gt;</code> will be
    accessible on the renderObj like <code>renderObj.props.design</code>, and
    in the Script or Template CParts like <code>props.design</code>.</li>

    <li>Prop set like: <code>&lt;x-Chart data:='["a", "b"]'&gt;</code> will be
    accessible on the renderObj like <code>renderObj.props.data</code> (with
    individual items accessed with code that ends with "<code>.data[0]</code>"),
    and in the Script or Template CParts like <code>props.data</code>.</li>
</ol>

definition and use of the component.

<blockquote><p><strong>Custom vs Script CPart</strong> - The general rule of
thumb is that <em>Script</em> tags are for custom, component-specific behavior,
or to fill in gaps in stitching together other CParts, while writing Custom
CParts is for interfacing with async, APIs, or any time that a Script CPart
gets too cumbersome.  Modulo's philosophy is to allow separation of work
between <em>component development</em> (HTML, CSS, templating, and high-level
behavior), and <em>CPart development</em> (complex JavaScript and
APIs).</p></blockquote>

<p><em>Script</em> CParts allow you to define custom behavior for components
using the full power of JavaScript. The most common use of <em>Script</em> tags
is to add more sophisticated interactive behavior. Instead of just relying on
premade CParts, with a Script tag you can program any custom behavior into your
component.</p>



<h3>Definition</h3>

<p><em>Script</em> is traditionally included in <em>Component</em> definitions
below the <em>State</em> or <em>Template</em> tag. <em>Script</em> has no
expected attributes, but instead only has a text-content.</p>

<h4>Typical use</h4>

<p>The most common use of a <em>Script</em> CPart is to specify custom JS code
that is either run once after fulling loading all dependencies, or once each
time the component renders. See below for a simple example:</p>

<mws-demo text="
<Component name=&quot;ButtonExample&quot;>
    <Template>...</Template>
    <State>...</State>
    <Script>
        console.log(&quot;Will execute once after loading dependencies&quot;);
        function initializedCallback() {
            console.log(&quot;Executes every time an instance of ButtonExample is created&quot;);
        }
        function updateCallback() {
            console.log(&quot;Executes after every rerender of the component&quot;);
        }
    </Script>

<h4>Using within embedded component definitions</h4>

<p>Problems arise when attempting to include a <em>Script</em> CPart within an
embedded Component <code>&lt;script&nbsp;Modulo&gt;</code>definition, e.g. one
that is being defined within the script tag of the same HTML file that it is
being used on. This is because the <code>&lt;/Script&gt;</code> tag will end up
closing off the outer <code>script</code> tag early, due to HTML syntax. The
ideal solution is to simply move the component to a separate library file,
included with <code>-src=</code> syntax, since that is preferred in general,
and solves other issues as well (e.g. templating instructions in HTML tags).
However, if you simply must include a <em>Script</em> tag in an embedded
component definition you can write <code>&lt;cpart Script&gt;</code> as the
opening tag, and <code>&lt;/cpart&gt;</code> as the closing tag.  See the
following:</p>

<mws-demo text="
<script Modulo src=&quot;https://modulojs.org/js/Modulo.js&quot;>
    <Component name=&quot;ButtonExample&quot;>
        <cpart Script>
            console.log(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
        </cpart>
    </Component>

<h3>Defining event callbacks</h3>

certain "events" occur to your component. Consider the following example:</p>

    ">
    

    <div class="editor-toolbar">
        <p style="font-size: 11px; width: 120px; margin-right: 10px; text-align: right;
                     display: none; ">
            <em>Note: This is meant for exploring features. Your work will not be saved.</em>

                    <eg-hello modulo-original-html="">
    <button @click:="script.countUp">Hello 42</button>

</mws-demo>

<p>In this, the <em>Script</em> CPart defines a function named
<code>countUp</code>. The <code>@click:=</code> attribute on the button
utilizes directives to attach a "click event" to the button, such that when a
user clicks on that button it will invoke the <code>countUp</code>
function.</p>

<p>From within event callbacks, the <em>Script</em> CPart exposes the current
renderObj as variables. So, <code>state</code> by itself is equivalent to
<code>renderObj.state</code>. This enables us to directly modify the state by
simply doing <code>state.count++</code>. By default, components rerender after
every event, so after the event the component will rerender and visually
reflect the state changes.</p>

<p>This means that all renderObj variables will be available here, in a similar
way to how <em>Template</em> exposes them: For example, you can use code like
<code>props.XYZ</code> to access data from a <em>Props</em> CPart.</p>

<p>You can also access the JavaScript Object instances of the CPart Class. To
access those, you use the <code>cparts</code></p>

<p>Finally, the variable <code>element</code> will refer to the HTML element of
the current component. This is useful for direct DOM manipulation or
interfacing with other frameworks or "vanilla" JavaScript. Generally, however,
you should avoid direct DOM manipulation whenever you can, instead using a
<em>Template</em> CPart to render the component (otherwise, the
<em>Template</em> will override whatever direct manipulation you do!).</p>


<h3>Static execution context</h3>

<p>The contents of the script tag is executed <em>exactly once</em> during the
"factory" phase that prepares a component class. This means that that any loose
variables defined will be "static", or shared between all instances of that
component.</p>

<mws-demo text="
<Template>
    <button @click:=script.increment>Click me</button>
</Template>
<Script>
    // &quot;Static&quot; execution context. We only have access to global variables:
    console.log(&quot;The global modulo instance is here:&quot;, modulo);
    console.log(&quot;But element is undefined:&quot;, element);

    // Variables defined in this &quot;static&quot; context are shared globally.
    // Nonetheless, this is run in a function, so it still is private.
    let count = 0;

    function increment() {
        count++;
        console.log(&quot;Shared count between different components:&quot;, count);
    }

<h3>Defining lifecycle or directive callbacks</h3>

<p>By naming functions with certain names, you can "hook into" the component
rendering lifecycle with callbacks. You can also create "custom directives"
from within the Script tag. Read more about this in the section on <a href="/docs/directives.html">Lifecycle &amp; Directives</a></p>

<p>See below for an example of defining a custom <code>prepareCallback</code>
in order to "hook into" the component rendering lifecycle to execute custom
code. The return value of this function is available to the <em>Template</em>
CPart when it renders during the <code>render</code> lifecycle.</p>

<p>All "group 2" and "group 3" lifecycle phase can be specified. This means
you can define a function with any of the following names and expect it to be
invoked during it's namesake lifecycle phase:
    <code>initializedCallback</code>, <code>prepareCallback</code>,
    <code>renderCallback</code>, <code>reconcileCallback</code>, and finally
    <code>updateCallback</code>.
</p>

<p>Note that there is no "factory" callback, since the <code>factory</code>
phase is when the code in the script tag itself gets executed. That is to say,
the entire script tag is the factory phase. See previous section for more on
this.</p>

<h3>Callback execution context: The "callback wrapper"</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Implicit Script CPart</strong> Mostly, Modulo follows the rule:
"Explicit is better than implicit".  The <em>Script</em> CPart, however, is an
exception.  It has an implicit or "magical" feature of setting up execution
context for each callback function before that callback function is run.</p>
</blockquote><p></p>

<p>The Script CPart's "callback wrapper" is what enables us to write
<code>state.count</code> in the <code>countUp</code> function.  Magically, the
"state" variable here refers to the state of that specific button, not of a
global state between all buttons.</p>

<p>By default, all public functions get implicitly "wrapped" with this callback
wrapper right before being executed from an event, lifecycle phase, or another
CPart. If the Script tag had not set up the <code>state</code> variable to
refer to the state of the current, individual button, it would be undefined or,
worse yet, refer to the state of a <em>different</em> button, such as one
elsewhere on the page. This can effectively cause <strong>events from one
component to modify the state of another component</strong>, causing a nasty
bug of mismatching events.</p>

<p>This "magic" only occurs in public functions that are called as events by
other CParts. Asynchronous coding is already discouraged in <em>Script</em>
tags, which means that's the only "magic" necessary. However, if there are
asynchronous functions, it won't always correctly apply the "magic" setup
beforehand.</p>
<p>This means that <strong>the <em>Script</em> tag discourages use of
asynchronous coding.</strong> If you must, wrap any asynchronous callback using
<code>cparts.script.cb()</code> in order to provide that execution context, and
use <code>element.rerender</code> to manually rerender. See below for an
example of this:</p>

            .then(cparts.script.cb(data => {
                // Note that this callback is &quot;wrapped&quot; with
                // &quot;cparts.script.cb(  ...  )&quot;
                state.data = data; // update state
                element.rerender(); // force rerender

<p>Ideally, however, asynchronous coding should be written into the features of
a custom CPart, that is then used in the script tag in a declarative,
synchronous manner. The CPart API gives you low-level access, and makes no
assumptions about using a synchronous or asynchronous coding style.</p>




<h3>renderObj</h3>

<p>The Script CPart "exports" a variety of properties to the
<code>renderObj</code>, all of which should be considered "read-only".</p>


<ul>
    <li><code>script.someFunctionName</code> for functions declared like
    <code>function&nbsp;someFunctionName</code> - In addition to "exports", the
    script tag will also make available all functions that you have declared
    using the "old-school" named-function style syntax. This is what allows
    attaching events to be so simple: Simply define a named-function in your
    script tag (e.g.
    <code>function&nbsp;doStuff(payload,&nbsp;ev)&nbsp;{&nbsp;...</code>), and
    then it can be referenced elsewhere (e.g. in the template with:
    <code>@click:=script.doStuff</code> template with a click event like: It
    will ignore any "arrow functions" (<code>()&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;{}</code>), or any other
    anonymous functions (e.g. functions declared like
    <code>const&nbsp;myFunc&nbsp;=&nbsp;function&nbsp;()&nbsp;{&nbsp;...</code>
    will also be ignored). That's not to say you can't declare your functions
    like this: However, you should only do so if you do not want them to be
    automatically exported.</li>

    <li><code>script.exports</code> - This gives you fine-grained control,
    allowing you to export arbitrary static variables, functions, or data. This
    is useful for building up static data structures to be shared between all
    instances of this component, which can then be accessed in the template.
    This <em>should not</em> be used as a store or state variable (use the
    <em>Store</em> CPart for that). Also, it should not be used for simply
    storing static data that requires no further code or manipulation (use the
    <em>StaticData</em> CPart for this). For example:
<mws-demo demotype="minipreview" text="
<Template>
    <p>{% for item in script.exports.bigArray %}
        {{ item }},
    {% endfor %}</p>
</Template>
<Script>
    script.exports.bigArray =
        Array.from({ length: 100 })
        .map((val, i) => `i liek ${i} turtles`);
</Script>

        <a class="secanchor" title="Click to focus on this section." id="state" name="state" href="#state">#</a>
        <h2>State</h2>
    </mws-section>

<p>The <em>State</em> is for component instances to store changing data. This
could include anything from text a user entered into a form, data received from
an API, or data that represents UI flow changes, such as the visibility of a
modal. For more discussion of State, see <a href="/docs/tutorial_part3.html#state">Tutorial Part 3</a>.</p>

<p>State data is unique to every component instance, and components can never
directly access each-others data. It is possible to indirectly reference it,
however, by passing state data from a "parent" component to a "child"
components within the parent by passing it via a <em>Props</em> attribute. In
this case, the data should be considered read-only to the child component, like
any other <em>Props</em> data. If you want to share data between components
globally, such that any component can modify the data causing a re-render to
all linked components, such as user log-in information or global state data,
you should consider the <a href="#store">Store CPart (not yet implemented)</a>.</p>


<h3>Definition</h3>

<p>State is traditionally included in Component definitions below the
<em>Template</em> tag, but above the <em>Script</em> tag. This makes sense
because functions in the <em>Script</em> tag typically manipulate state in
order to render new HTML in the <em>Template</em>, making <em>Script</em> a
sort of mutable bridge between <em>Script</em> and <em>Template</em>. State is
defined in a similar way to Props: Only defined with properties, but no
contents.</p>

<p>See below for an example of defining a <em>State</em> CPart:</p>

<mws-demo text="
<!-- Example 1: Two variables specified -->
<State
    name=&quot;Luiz&quot;
    favenum:=13
></State>

<!-- Example 2: Many variables of different types -->
<State
    color=&quot;blue&quot;      (String)
    count:=1          (Number)
    ready:=true       (Boolean)
    speed:=null       (null value)
    items:='[         (JSON Array)
        &quot;abc&quot;,
        &quot;def&quot;
    ]'
    data_obj:='{      (JSON Object)
        &quot;a&quot;: &quot;b&quot;,
        &quot;c&quot;: &quot;d&quot;

<p>Note that all "state variables" <em>must</em> have an initial value. It's
okay to make the initial value be <code>null</code> (as in the "speed" example
above), or other some placeholder that will later be replaced.</p>


<h3>CPart properties</h3>

<p>The actual data in a <em>State</em> CPart is stored on it's "data" property.
This property is a regular JavaScript Object, and thus can store any JavaScript
data type.  As an example, in a <em>Script</em> CPart, you can directly
reference this property with the code <code>cparts.state.data</code>.</p>

<p>When writing the <em>State</em> CPart definition, you must declare or
pre-define each "state variable" or property of the "data" Object that you want
to use. It is not permitted to create new state variables later on. In other
words, if you only define <code>cparts.state.data</code> as having
<code>.count</code> and <code>.title</code> as "state variables" (aka
properties of the "data" Object), then an attempt like
<code>cparts.state.data.newstuff = 10;</code> may result in an error.  If you
are dealing with a situation where you have an unknown quantity of data, such
as from an API, the correct approach is to store it all within a nested Object
<em>inside</em> the state data Object, e.g. such as an
<code>data.apiResults</code> Object or Array. Unlike top-level "state
variables", it's okay to add properties, modify, or build upon nested
Objects.</p>

<p>While it's allowed to assign any arbitrary reference as a <em>State</em>
variable, including complex, unserializable types such as function callbacks,
it's highly recommended to try to keep it to primitive and serializable types
as much as possible (e.g. String, Number, Boolean, Array, Object). The reason
being that there may be future features or third-party add-ons for
<em>State</em> which will only support primitive types (as an example, that
would be required to save state to localStorage). If you want to store
functions, consider using a <code>prepareCallback</code> to generate the
functions within a Script context, and only store the data needed to "generate"
the function in the state (as opposed to storing a direct reference to the
function itself).</p>



<h3>renderObj</h3>

<p>State contributes it's current data values to the renderObj. Examples:</p><p>

</p><ul>
    <li>State initialized like: <code>&lt;State&nbsp;name="Luiz"&gt;</code> will be
    accessible on the renderObj like <code>renderObj.state.name</code>, and in
    the Script or Template CParts like <code>state.name</code>.</li>

    <li>State initialized like: <code>&lt;State stuff:='["a", "b"]'&gt;</code>
    will be accessible on the renderObj like <code>renderObj.state.info</code>
    (with individual items accessed with code that ends with
    "<code>.stuff[0]</code>"), and in the Script or Template CParts like
    <code>state.info</code>.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Directives</h3>

<p>State provides a single directive:</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>[state.bind]</code> - Two-way binding with State data, with the
    key determined by the <code>name=</code> property of whatever it is
    attached to.  You can attach a <code>[state.bind]</code> directive to any
    HTML <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>, and the <em>State</em> CPart's two-way
    binding will cause the input value to be updated if the state variable ever
    changes, and if a user edits the input triggering a <code>"keyup"</code> or
    <code>"change"</code> event, the state variable will be updated (along
    with, typically, a re-render of the component).

    <h3>Example</h3>
    TODO: Replace with simpler one
-->


<mws-section name="staticdata" modulo-original-html="StaticData">
        <a class="secanchor" title="Click to focus on this section." id="staticdata" name="staticdata" href="#staticdata">#</a>
        <h2>StaticData</h2>
    </mws-section>

<p>The <em>StaticData</em> CPart is useful for loading JSON files to use as a
data source. StaticData has no "refresh" capability, meaning this should only
consist data that you do not expect to change while running your program, such
as type definitions or data from a API that does not change frequently.</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>The StaticData CPart can be used in two different ways. The most common is
loading data from a JSON file or JSON API by specifying a <code>src=</code>
attribute. During development, this will "fetch" when refreshing the page, but
once you "build" the component using <code>build()</code> or
<code>bundle()</code>, the JSON file or JSON-based API will no longer be
fetched.  When using <code>build()</code> or <code>bundle()</code>, the
specified content will be "frozen in time" during the build, and bundled in
with the resulting JS file.</p>

<p>The other usage is to simply "hardcode" the data in JSON syntax within the
element itself. There is no functional difference of including data in JSON
syntax in a StaticData CPart to simply adding a Script CPart that uses
<code>script.exports</code> to expose data, other than it being slightly more
convenience (e.g. less typing), and intentionally less flexible compared to a
script CPart.</p>

<p>Note: Currently, StaticData supports JavaScript Object syntax by default,
NOT JSON syntax. This default might change in the future, to only strictly
support JSON (e.g., require double-quotes, error on trailing commas), offering
the looser structure.</p>

<h3>attrs</h3>

<ul>
    <li><code>src</code> - Just like any other CParts, the <code>src=</code>
    attribute lets you load the content from another URL.
    This could be from an API (e.g. something like
    <code>src="https://some.api.com/v1/getdata?p=3"</code>), or for loading
    from a file (e.g.  <code>src="./data/weatherData.json"</code>), or for
    loading from a file. If not specified, then the data must be specified
    within the StaticData tag, or else it will be simply "undefined".</li>

    <li><code>transform</code> - This optional attribute can be set to a
    function (e.g.  using <code>:=</code> data-prop syntax) that takes a single
    string as input (the original data) and outputs a single string (the
    transformed data), which should be a valid JavaScript expression that will
    result in the data format that you want. Generally, this JavaScript
    expression should be JS primitives, such as in JSON format. This happens
    before build() and bundle(), meaning it this JS expression will be what
    gets included in the built JS file.  By default, no transformation is done,
    and the input is expected to already be valid JSON to be inserted
    verbatim.</li>
</ul>


<h3>renderObj</h3>

<p>The StaticData CPart exposes it's data directly (e.g. so it can be accessed
in Script, Template, etc).</p>

        <h2>Style</h2>
    </mws-section>

<p>The <em>Style</em> CPart allows us to write CSS for our component. This
allows us to group styles within our component, and keep them isolated from
other components, without having to come up with long, confusing class names
every time.  CSS written here will be automatically prefixed so that it will
only apply to your component and/or any HTML that it generates, such as by the
<em>Template</em> CPart. The <em>Style</em> CPart has no other features, other
than prefixing or scoping CSS.</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>In general, you can freely write any number of CSS rules for your
components. They will be prefixed based on a few regular expression replacement
steps, such that they only apply to the elements within your component. For
example, a rule like <code>a&nbsp;{&nbsp;color:&nbsp;blue&nbsp;}</code> in a
component named <code>name="HelloBtn"</code> that has been imported with
<code>namespace="mylib"</code> would result in the following, fully-prefixed
rule: <code>mylib-HelloBtn&nbsp;a&nbsp;{&nbsp;color:&nbsp;blue&nbsp;}</code></p>

<p>Further behavior explained below:</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>:host</code> - Use the ":host" pseudo-element to select the
    component itself. This will work for both "regular" and "shadow" rendering
    mode. For example, in regular rendering mode, if you have the CSS
    <code>:host&nbsp;{&nbsp;color:&nbsp;red&nbsp;}</code> in a component named
    <code>name="MyChart"</code> that has been imported with
    <code>namespace="mylib"</code>, then it would create the following,
    fully-prefixed CSS rule:
    <code>mylib-MyChart&nbsp;{&nbsp;color:&nbsp;red&nbsp;}</code></li>

    <li><strong>Shadow vs regular DOM</strong> - By default, components have
    "regular" rendering mode. If you've configured your component to instead
    use "Shadow DOM" rendering to protect it from getting outside CSS applied
    to it, then the <em>Style</em> CPart's stylesheet will be "encapsulated" or
    inserted in the "shadow root" of component instances, as opposed to the
    document root.  (More on this here: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ShadowRoot/styleSheets">MDN's
    "ShadowRoot.styleSheets"</a>)</li>
</ul>

        <h2>Template</h2>
    </mws-section>

<p>The <em>Template</em> CPart allow components to render their HTML content
using a small domain-specific language, called the "templating engine". The
default engine is the <em>Modulo templating language</em> (aka "MTL"), although
that can be configured on a per-CPart basis.</p>

<p>Without a <em>Template</em> CPart (or equivalent custom code), the default
behavior of the <em>Component</em> CPart is to make no attempt to alter their
contents. However, most components require complicated HTML structures within
them. This is where Templates come into play: They generate the
<code>innerHTML</code> of a component.</p>

<p>Templates are not DOM-based, but instead render synchronously to a String
during the <code>render</code> <a href="/docs/directives.html#lifecycle">lifecycle phase</a>, and store the
results in <code>renderObj.component.innerHTML</code>. The <em>Component</em>
CPart will read this HTML code during the <code>reconcile</code> phase and then
"reconcile", modify it's contents to resemble the target innerHTML. (More on
this is in <a href="#component">the Component CPart documentation
above</a>.)</p>


<p>Every time a Component renders, the Template will render using the
<em>renderObj</em> as a "template context", or, in other words, using the
various CPart's contributions to the <em>renderObj</em> as Template variables
that can be inserted into the HTML.  For more discussion of Template, see
<a href="/docs/tutorial_part2.html#templating">Tutorial Part 2</a>.</p>
