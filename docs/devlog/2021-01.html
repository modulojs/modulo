<h3><span alt="Question mark">?</span></h3>


<p>I wrote this FAQ in late 2020 and early 2021 when I began to "resurrect" the
Modulo project around a new set of goals: Choosing the name <em>Modulo</em>,
relaxing the 500-line limit I had imposed previously, and making it much more
modular and beginner friendly, and thus more strongly adhering to "KISS"
principles. This FAQ, like every FAQ, is an imaginary conversation between the
creator (myself) of Modulo and imaginary people who apparently are invested in
Modulo enough to ask probing questions about it. That said, if you are a
non-imaginary person (I should hope so!) with questions about Modulo, they are
welcome even more: Contact via email, submit a pull request to this page, or
add an issue to the project on GitHub.</p>


<h3>FAQ</h3>

<p>By reading this FAQ, you will get a better understanding of the motivation
of building Modulo and it's design philosophy.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Q: Why yet another JavaScript framework?</strong></p>
<p>A: To me, the very idea of writing YET ANOTHER JavaScript framework
is vomit inducing.<br>And yet here I am.</p>

<p>While working at Kickstart Coding, developing our Django-based
LMS, nothing quite fit the bill for a very simple JS framework to
sprinkle in some extra interactive features to an otherwise very
straight-forward multi-page web app. The current solution was a
mess of Vue and scattered vanilla JavaScript (okay, and a few old
jQuery plugins, that we'll totally get rid of ASAP totally), with
the build-step and mounting code for the Vue code getting almost as
complicated as the little it was even doing.</p>
<p>We didn't have the developer bandwidth needed for a SPA, and the
poor state of JS code was slowing down building features, not to
mention the brittle mounting process was hard to test.  If only I
could just <em>go in there and do some JS</em> without any more
fuss... but also develop using hot-reloading and a bundle in the
end. So, I gave up, gave in, and became the problem. I wrote yet
another JavaScript component framework.</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Q: Any future plans?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, plenty! The three main ones: SSG, server-side, and MDU.
Currently, this site is already getting generated with a
Modulo-based SSG. However, it's undocumented and messy, so it still
needs work before it's released externally. On a similar note,
there are plans for a JAMstack-style SSG + server-side combo, with
live-refresh inspired by Phoenix LiveView. Finally, developing this
site requires developing some key components, so I also hope to
have time to document and release "mdu", which will be a standard
library of Modulo components, including a Router system inspired by
React Router.</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Q: Why do you care so much about short source code
files? Don't you want a framework that does more?</strong></p>

<p>A: In my opinion, the most important feature about a framework
like this is documentation and structure, not functionality.
Specifically, my coding philosophy is that good frameworks should
have aim first and foremost to have a high "documentation to code"
ratio. This is because a framework is much more than simply a set
of libraries to import. Choosing a framework represents buy-in to
file and directory structures, recipes, best practices, code
patterns, and so on. I don't want to have to dig through
<em>other</em> people's code to figure out how to solve <em>my</em>
problems. Instead, a good framework should come "batteries
included" with documentation that clearly indicates how to solve
common problems.</p>

<p>Thus, to pump up our "doc/code" ratio, the easiest thing is to keep the
denominator as low as possible.  This is especially true for a new,
solo-developed framework project such as this one.  Similarly, I think that
frameworks should seek to be as simple and elegant as possible, especially in
this case, when the framework is a layer on top of existing web standards (the
web component standard). In this case, adding anything more would constitute
over-engineering.</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Q: Can't you have both, however? Maybe not as a solo project, but
can't you have a big, extensive framework with big and extensive
documentation?</strong></p>

<p>Sure, it's possible, in some cases situations better, and you can use always
that too.  Modulo plays well with others! However, Modulo takes a different
approach.  See the <a href="/devlog/2021-09.html">the design philosophy "thought
experiment"</a> article for for further and more thorough discussion of
Modulo's approach and it's motivation.</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Q: 80 char line limit? 4 space indentation? Imperative
coding? What is this, the 90's?</strong></p>

<p>A: Another motivating factor for developing Modulo was how much I
appreciates libraries such as Django that maintain high quality docs and code,
and have an easy-to-follow codebase that you can always go to to understand
exact ordering or behavior of certain operations or steps. This is contrasted
with other libraries which seem to be designed first and foremost to go fast
and pass tests, but not for thorough documentation, or self-documenting code.
This is not a slight on any particular library, nor is it a claim that I write
better code—in fact, outside of Modulo.js itself, all the tooling code in
this repo is a mess!  However, for Modulo.js itself, I invested most of the
development time in refactoring it over and over (and over and over), until the
code and logical flow was as simple as possible. My goal is to make the code
readable and be a good example for novice coders. I want engineers of all skill
levels to be able to understand <em>why</em> the framework behaves the way it
does by simply reading the code that powers certain features.</p>

<p>That's where the coding standard comes in. Shorter line length and "more
intense" indentation requirements naturally causes simpler, less convoluted
code, causing desirable side-effects such as lower cyclomatic complexity in
functions. It might not be "pleasant" to write under these conditions, but code
is written once and read 1000 times. Modulo code was written to be easily read,
not easily written.</p>

<p>Note: Linting configs are still an unresolved bug, meaning this coding
standard is partially aspirational.</p>


<hr>
<p><strong>Q: Why call it Modulo?</strong></p>
<p>A: From Wikipeda: “In mathematics, the term modulo is often used to
assert that two distinct mathematical objects can be regarded as equivalent if
their difference is accounted for by an additional factor.” Basically,
it's math jargon to say two things are equivalent in a given condition or
context.</p>

<p>So, maybe the goal of Modulo is provide that context, making a natural way
to integrate the new and the old! Or maybe it sounded cool. Maybe that!</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Q: Isn't <em>Modulo</em> already a thing in
JavaScript?</strong>
</p><p>Interestingly, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Remainder">MDN's
JavaScript documentation describes it's <code>%</code> as not being a
modulo operator</a>!
Instead, it calls the percent sign a <em>remainder operator</em>,
which behaves similarly for some numbers, but differs for negative
numbers. So, while Modulo.js is not the first thing to be called
<abbr title="At the time of picking the name, there were a couple
similarly named projects, though none seem to be in active use or
development for years.">"Modulo" in JS</abbr> it <em>is not</em>
named after the <code>%</code> operator in JavaScript, making
the logo a bit of a tongue-in-cheek joke.</p>
