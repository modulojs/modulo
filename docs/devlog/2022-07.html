</mws-devlognav>



<p>Modulo was developed with several goals in mind. Here are a few of them, in
no particular order, with a brief explanation of each:</p>

<ul>
    <li>HTML-first (Modulo is a <em>HTML framework</em>, first and
    foremost)</li>
    <li>Complexity layers (Complexity should be out-of-sight for simple
    things)</li>
    <li>Declarative (Coding should feel like configuration)</li>
    <li>Isomorphic (DOM determines behavior, behavior determines DOM)</li>
    <li>Explicit (Middleware is included and referenced explicitly)</li>
    <li>Simple (KISS - Keep it simple, silly!)</li>
    <li>Educational (Using Modulo should make you better at other
    frameworks)</li>
</ul>



<h2>How Modulo aims to be <em>HTML-first</em></h2>

<p>Modulo aims to be much more HTML-oriented compared to other web framework.
In some ways, it's could be thought of as more of an <em>HTML framework written
in JavaScript</em> than a <em>JavaScript framework written in
JavaScript</em>.</p>

<ol>

<li><h3>HTML-first syntax</h3>
    <p>Modulo is <em>HTML-first</em> in that it piggy-backs off of HTML syntax.
    Component Parts are declared using HTML tags, within other HTML tags, as
    opposed to within JavaScript. It follows HTML syntax and semantics,<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> and does not include a custom parser, so it can be
    compatible with the browser's parser.  Script tags embed JS into HTML,
    instead of the other way around (e.g. JSX in React).</p>

</li>

<li><h3>HTML-first workflow</h3>
    <p>Secondly, it is <em>HTML-first</em> in terms of development
    workflow. A greenfield Modulo-powered website starts as a static site
    of HTML and CSS files, created and edited by hand.  As the requirements become more demanding,
    the vanilla HTML tags are gradually swapped for Modulo web-components, with
    templated HTML and bundled CSS. Only as requirements grow beyond the common
    use-cases offered by "canned" CParts does JavaScript come into play.</p>
</li>

<li><h3>HTML-first integration</h3>
    <p>Finally it is <em>HTML-first</em> in terms of interoperability.  Modulo
    exposes itself as a extension to vanilla HTML via the Web Components
    standard. The boilerplate is as lightweight possible: Typically just ~4
    lines (Modulo tag, possibly including a Library), and you can now integrate
    your Modulo HTML components throughout the rest of the HTML.  This means it
    will comfortably integrate with anything that deals with HTML, e.g. PHP, Django,
    Rails, and even other frontend frameworks.</p>
</li>
</ol>



<h2>HTML-first and Web 1.0 trends</h2>

<p>For a slight digression, the rest of this article will be to compare /
contrast this "HTML-first" mentality with the growingly popular so-called "Web
1.0" trends.</p>

<p>I've been noticing more and more developers online, especially the 90s web
old-heads out there, reminiscing over the simpler times of Web 1.0. This trend
is seen in a wide range, from minimalist bare-HTML to the GIF-laden
retro-aesthetic. Both extremes are related to an increasingly dominant design
trend, somewhat ostentatiously described as <em>Web Neau Brutalism</em>.  This
trend isn't just aesthetic, however. It is also a reaction to how Internet
users increasingly use centralized platforms (social media, mobile apps, etc),
and how the Internet, a tool once presented as an open, scientific platform for
information and communication seems mostly just a tool for tech companies to
churn out new ad platforms, in some cases adding little substantial innovation
beyond creating marketing and GUIs to libraries developed at public
universities.  Web 1.0 is thus representing an “<em>actually</em>
decentralized and user-controlled space for storing knowledge and
communication”.<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>I admit, as a web developer who started in the 90s, I'm squarely in the
right demographic, and not surprisingly I generally agree with the aims of this
"trend", if it could be said to have aims.  However, I wouldn't even really say
that Modulo is part of the "Web 1.0 trend", as it's built on top of the
extremely complex execution environments that the modern web standards for
web-browsers specify.  That makes it quite the opposite of the simple elegance
of, for example, the Gopher protocol, the failed alternative that could have
saved us from the mess of HTTP (or so say its advocates) <sup><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup>. That said, there's a clear similarity, as I took a
pretty different approach for Modulo than most other JS frameworks. I wanted
something that you can ignore until you need to use it, so you can focus on
plain, static HTML and CSS and only think about framework aspects when you need
to refactor. Despite the complex execution environment, I hope the Modulo
component development workflow itself will feel like a similar return to
fundamentals for other developers as well!</p>

<p>In this way, I hope that Modulo might fill the need for a bit of a
compromise: A JS framework that the ascetic "90s-web" nerds tolerate, while
also being appealing to everyone else, e.g. provide those "creature-comforts"
to lure in developers in the various JSX or TypeScript ecosystems. Thus, the
goal of Modulo is to accommodate ~75% of actual day-to-day web dev use-cases,
and give sufficient documentation so the remaining 25% can get filled in
without too much pain.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading my post!</p>

    <li>1: Despite leveraging HTML's tolerance of things like capitalization
    (e.g. <code>&lt;Template&gt;</code>), using capitalization like this ultimately
    just a different suggestion for coding style, other than the more common
    style for HTML of all-lowercase, or the less common ALL-UPPERCASE, for tags
    and attributes.
    </li>
    <a name="fn2"></a>

    <li>2: When I say "actually decentralized", I mean as opposed to those
    various Ponzi scams these days that dishonestly use cool words like
    "decentralized" to imitate Computer Science jargon and sucker people
    in.</li>

    <a name="fn3"></a>
    <li>3: The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)">Gopher
    Protocol</a> is a menu-based, intentionally limited protocol. It is seeing
    a bit bit of a renaissance among web developers who subscribe to the trends
    described here, and argue that it would never have gotten "bloated" like
    the HTML/CSS/JS execution environment served with the HTTP protocol.
    Pessimistically, I think that HTTP's bloat would have just happened to
    Gopher, since the bad stuff happened due to "corporate" and "money"
    reasons, not because we're still waiting on "the final ultimate solution to
    the protocol problem" (much like the mythical <a href="https://www.dmuth.org/fussp/">FUSSP</a>).</li>
