<p>The main focus of Modulo Alpha development at this point is overhauling the
API to make custom component parts. This is because the current internal API
had inconsistencies and limitations, and it was clearly the absolute central
way to extend the framework, and thus very important to get correct before
beta. I'm happy to say that the bulk of the internal and CPart API is stable,
and the remaining bugs only involve documenting, a few new features and tweaks,
and fixing any straggling nested errors.</p>

<p>A quick overview of the new API features:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>register() API</strong>, which is a "plug-in" system, an easy
    way to attach (or override) classes and functions to the Modulo
    object</li>
    <li><strong>Definitions API</strong>, which is a complete rewrite of the
    internal loading API to be more transparent and data-oriented for
    debugging, while producing better builds</li>
    <li><strong>Config API</strong>, which is a powerful configuration system
    for both application configuration and 3rd party module configuration.</li>
    <li><strong>Processor API</strong> which allows for static functions to
    iterate on definitions, either private to definition classes (as static
    methods), or as public, re-usable mixins (which is how <code>-src=</code>
    is implemented)</li>
</ol>

<p>Part of the reason I had to rewrite it this way was to support adding the
following features:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Stable builds</strong> with fully bundled self-contained JS,
    CSS, and HTML (from the browser or CLI)</li>
    <li><strong>CPart feature improvements</strong>, including State allowing
    for Stores (globally connected data)</li>
</ol>
