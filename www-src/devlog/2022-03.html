<p>After years of development as a side-project, Modulo is close to an "alpha"
release. The plan for the alpha release is to get early feedback before we
finalize the external API, or spend time optimizing for DOM performance or
readability of source-code.</p>

<h3>After alpha?</h3>

<p>Once the API is more or less finalized, and the library itself has enjoyed
some limited ("dogfooding") production usage, then it's time for the "beta"
release. Finally, as it gets more production usage, it's time for the
<code>v1.0</code> release, which is intended to be a highly stable release for
the future, with few, if any new features.</p>

<h3>Known bugs</h3>

<p><strong>Directives nested in child components are broken</strong>: Directive
resolution context for child components with non-shadow slots still has issues,
resolving to the immediate parent (the child component) instead of the more
expected parent (the parent doing the nesting).</p>

<p><strong>m.bundle</strong>: Incomplete</p>


<h3>Major incomplete aspects of API</h3>

<p>Library / Load / Loader / Module / Config / Modulo configuration refactor:
Currently, a variety of CParts do similar tasks. We want to condense them all
into a new "Library" CPart, and abandon "Module" terminology, since it can
easily be confused with the unrelated concept of JavaScript modules.</p>
