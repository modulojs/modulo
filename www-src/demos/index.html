    This is the source code to Modulo's Demo page, and shows how Modulo's own
    website was built. Copying and pasting this into any HTML document will
    "import" Modulo's entire layout into that page. Examine the 4 comments
    below for a little tour of how a Modulo's web page is built!
-->


<!-- 1. The 4 lines of boilerplate that initialize Modulo, and import a common
header HTML file (all.html), which in turn imports all needed libraries -->
<script Modulo
    src="/js/Modulo.js"
    -src="/libraries/all.html" 
></script>


<!-- 2. <mws-Page> is a "vanish-into-document" component, meaning it will
replace the entire document tree. It's Template is the base page layout. -->
<mws-Page
    docbarselected="/demos/"
    pagetitle="Examples"
    navbar="docs">

<!-- 3. The docbar, pagetitle, and navbar props control the left-hand
navigation, the <title> tag, and the navbar's selection respectively. Within
the mws-Page Template, templating statements like if statements, for loops, etc
selectively highlight items in the sidebar and navbar. -->

<h1>Examples</h1>

<!-- 4. The rest of the file is just the content of the page, which will get
slotted into the mws-Page layout -->

<p>This page has a collection of larger demos and library of mini-examples.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Unlike every other page at modulojs.org, this page is
NOT pre-rendered! That means you can use "View Source" (Right click, or Ctrl+U)
to see how Modulo's own website was built.</p>

    <h4>How to "fork" a Modulo.js demo</h4>
    <p>Some of tiles below link to full-page demonstration apps.  These are
    intended as a reference of &ldquo;copy &amp; paste recipes&rdquo; so you
    can get started even quicker with incorporating Modulo into your
    project.</p>
    <p>Every demo can be "forked" (copied) by clicking the "COPY SOURCE" button
    in the top-right. Then, it can be pasted into a local HTML file in your
    text editor. <!--All demos have been designed with absolute URLs, so they
    should &ldquo;just work&rdquo; if pasted in any HTML code, whether that is
    a backend app template (e.g. PHP, Rails, Django), or a static HTML
    file. (Alpha note: Some are relative, need correcting.)--></p>

<p>These HTML and Zip files are intended to help you start new projects, with
example components already made, to make remembering syntax easier, and Modulo
all configured and ready to go.  Use one of these demo pages to get a
head-start with your own Modulo project.</p>

<h2>SPA: Modulo-based layouts</h2>

<p>Thinking Modulo will be taking a "center-stage" in your project, and
handling layout as well? These demos show how you can define Layout elements to
omit HTML boilerplate in your Modulo-powered valid HTML file.</p>

<mws-Section name="experiments">
    Experiments
</mws-Section>

<p><strong>Experimental:</strong> The following demos show off some of the cool
and unusual things you can get Modulo to do! However, they are designated
"experimental" either because they might be using internal APIs that could
change before the Modulo <em>beta</em>, or require a bit more polish before
they become fully recommended.</p>

<h2>Custom Component Parts</h2>

<p>The internal CPart API that is used by custom CParts may change before
<em>beta</em>, and will need further documentation. Read further for typical
uses of common CParts:</p>


<ul class="DemoPanels">
    <li>
        <a href="/demos/custom_cpart_for_api.html">Custom CParts for APIs</a>
        <p>A typical use of custom CParts is to abstract away APIs.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <a href="/demos/custom_cpart_for_jquery_fittext.html">Custom CParts for
        legacy frontend</a>
        <p>Modulo is useful as a glue to integrate with legacy libraries (in
        this case, FitText.js).</p>
    </li>
</ul>




<h2>Custom templating: Handlebars and JSX integrations</h2>

<p>Modulo templating and HTML generation can be customized at various levels.
You can register custom CParts, in the case of using React-style JSX syntax
which allows embedding of arbitrary JavaScript. You can also register a custom
<em>Templater</em> engine, which the existing <em>Template</em> CPart will
integrate into the render-flow, most notably including Modulo and third-party
filters into the other syntax.</p>


<ul class="DemoPanels">
    <li>
        <a href="/demos/handlebars_templater.html">Handlebars</a>
        <p>Demonstration of integrating Modulo with a custom <em>Templater</em>
        engine (in this case, Handlebars).</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <a href="/demos/jsx_template.html">JSX Templating</a>
        <p>Demonstration of integrating Babel JS and replacing Template CPart
        with custom CPart to enable React-style JSX-syntax in Modulo.</p>
    </li>

    <!--
      TODO: Needs update, probably wait until implement a NodeRequire CPart
      that would then make this much easier, e.g. allow specific React
      versions, allow importing of third-party React components, etc
    -->
    <!--
    <li>
        <a href="/demos/react_component.html">ReactComponent</a>
        <p>Demonstration of integrating React into a Modulo project, mixing
        components written in React with ones in Modulo.</p>
    </li>
    -->

</ul>

<!--
Should re-think FetchState, e.g. Have it bind with state or something,
simplify to handle only one route, not use templating, and if it can be
short enough, include in Modulo.js
<li>
    <a href="/demos/fetchstate_book_browser.html">FetchState API</a>
    <p>Demonstration of an API-backed, paginated book search app,
    <em>without</em> use of any JavaScript, beyond using the custom CPart
    <em>FetchState</em>.</p>
</li>
-->

<h2>Modulo for Sound & Music</h2>

<p>Modulo's declarative, configuration-focused approach  is especially
well-suited for sound and music related applications. The Tone JS CPart becomes
your own sound engineering "rack" of instruments and effects units, where any
"knob" or configuration setting can be bound to state, and thus to form
controls, just like anything else in Modulo.</p>

<p>NOTE: WebAudio API
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API#browser_compatibility">
has limited browser compatibility</a>.</p>

        some knobs to tweak.</p>

        <p>Demonstration of receiving MIDI keyboard input in Modulo, useful for

    </li>
</ul>



<h2>Unit testing demos</h2>


<p>MDU (a planned collection of CParts and other utilities) includes
<em>TestSuite</em>, a unit testing framework that is used to test Modulo.js
itself. Like other MDU CParts, it's usable already, but it's API may change in
the future.</p>


<ul class="DemoPanels">
    <li>
        <a href="/demos/testsuite_example.html">TestSuite Demo</a>
        <p>Show how you use the TestSuite CPart to write your own succinct
        unit-tests for your components.</p>
    </li>


    <li>
        <a href="/demos/tests/">Modulo.js Tests</a>
        <p>One way to check for browser-compatibility bugs is by running
        Modulo.js's full test-suite in a new tab. View the console for
        output.</p>
    </li>

        <p>Or, you can run it embedded in an iframe below. If you get anything
        other than "Success: true", consider filing a bug.</p>
