<h1>Core Definitions</h1>

<p>Core definitions can be placed at the top level of Modulo code. That is to
say, the definitions listed here (Artifact, Component, Configuration, and
Library) can all be defined at the top level of file loaded by <em>Modulo</em>
or <em>Library</em>, or embedded directly within a <em>Modulo</em> tag in the
<code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of the document. Typically, documentation on this
page is most useful when you want to dig into configuring Modulo to behave a
certain way across multiple pages, or interacting with other frameworks and
versions.</p>


<mws-Section name="artifact">Artifact</mws-Section>

<p>The <em>Artifact</em> definition is how you can specify custom build
artifacts. When the build command is run, Modulo loops through all defined
Artifacts and outputs the files they generate. This is how the JS, CSS, and
HTML files get generated whenever you run build by default. For most users,
this is enough--this website uses the default Artifacts, for example. However,
if you want to create custom build outputs for advanced usage in building a
SSG-powered site, then you can use this feature to create as many extra files
per HTML file you SSG as you'd like. For example, you could loop through
images, generating a "thumbnail" page for each one. It's very versatile, and
gives you the full power of the Modulo templating language for JS, CSS, and
prerendered / SSR'ed HTML.</p>

<p>It manages to be this versatile by functioning as a mini-scripting system
for specifying and configuring builds, allowing for easy addition of
minification, split bundles, or other file types. This gives very fine-grained
control over output in a declarative way.</p>

<p><strong>Alpha API</strong>: Note that the <em>Artifact</em> definition is
still in flux. In lieu of fully documenting while it is being changed, here is
the default build artifacts:</p>

<mws-Section name="component">Component</mws-Section>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Low-level interface</strong> - Component developers will typically
only need to use the <code>name="..."</code> attribute on <em>Component</em>,
and sometimes <code>mode="vanish-into-document"</code> for  page-level
components. Similarly, none of the <code>renderObj.component</code> properties
are typically useful for component developers. Instead, they are used
internally by CParts (notably <em>Template</em>) in order to move along the
rendering cycle.</p> </blockquote>

<p>The <em>Component</em> definition is the most central to Modulo. It's how we
register components to be mounted on the page, and define the CParts that
go inside those Components. It's also what stitches together the "machinery"
that makes reconciliation and rendering even possible. In other words, the
<em>Component</em>  is what handles the "low-level" operations of
mounting, reconciling to generate patches, and applying those patches to
rerender, and the interface described here allows for low-level manipulation of
this process for unusual circumstances when it's needed.</p>


<h3>renderObj</h3>

<p>The Component reads several properties from the
<code>renderObj</code>, at different lifecycle phases. Read below on how to
interface with it.</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>component.originalHTML</code> - <strong>Read-only</strong> -
    This contains the initial HTML that the element had when mounted on the
    page.</li>

    <li><code>component.innerHTML</code> - <strong>Write-only</strong> -
    Assign to this to cause the <em>Component</em> to attempt to
    reconcile the current HTML with the target HTML provided.
    It functions a little bit like HTML's built-in <em>"element.innerHTML"</em>:
    Assign a string containing HTML code to this property to see the HTML
    appear on the page. This is what the <em>Template</em> does behind
    the scenes. Unlike HTML's built-in <em>"element.innerHTML"</em>, assigning
    to this renderObj property will not cause an full update, overwriting
    everything that exists, but instead will cause the <em>Component</em> to
    employ the "reconciler" specified to generate a patches list (see next). By
    default, it will then also apply those patches in the <code>update</code>
    lifecycle.</li>

    <li><code>component.patches</code> - Between the <code>reconcile</code> and
    <code>update</code> stages, the "patches" property is exposed to allow
    access to or modification of the patches that the Component intends to
    apply. This is an advanced feature that gives fine-grained control to how
    rendering works, and thus is only useful in rare situations where that
    control is needed. For example, you could use this property to "intercept"
    the patches that are about to be applied to your component while
    re-rendering, and, for an example, forbid the removal of attributes by
    deleting all patches with <em>"removeAttribute"</em>. This is in the format
    of an Array. Each item in the Array is itself a 4-Array (Array of length
    4), in the following format: <code>[element, method, arg1, arg2]</code>.
    For example, to do a <em>"removeAttribute"</em> patch on an "id" attribute
    for a given "target element" (a real DOM node on the page somewhere), it
    might be
<code>[(ref&nbsp;to&nbsp;"target element"),&nbsp;"removeAttribute",&nbsp;"id",&nbsp;undefined]</code>
If the Array is empty, then no patches will be applied.
    </li>
</ul>


<h3>attrs</h3>

<p>Components use their attributes to set several configuration options.
They take the following attributes:</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>name</code> - <em>REQUIRED</em> - The "name" of the component.
    Conventionally, it should be written in camel or dromedary case, like
    how class names are written in JavaScript: <code>LikeThis</code>.
    Technically, it's case insensitive, so a component named like
    <code>LikeThis</code>, imported with an <code>x-</code> namespace, could
    also be used like <code>x-likethis</code> or <code>X-LIKETHIS</code>.</li>

    <li><code>engine</code> - <em>default is <code>engine="ModRec"</code></em> -
    The Reconciler Engine selected. By default, ModRec, the built-in Modulo
    Reconciler engine, is enabled. If you want to experiment with other
    reconciliation engines, such as ones that might be faster or take into
    account unusual scenarios, set this equal to another property of
    <code>Modulo.reconcilers</code>.</li>

    <li><code>rerender</code> - <em>default is
    <code>rerender="event"</code></em>.  Specify mode to change the render mode
    of this component.  A detailed discussion of valid options are below:
        <ul>
            <li><code>rerender="event"</code> - The default behavior, where the
            the component will rerender after ever event it handles (e.g. after
            every user interaction). This is typically desirable since usually
            every user interaction will cause some visual change that needs to
            be reflected.</li>

            <li><code>rerender="manual"</code> - Modulo will not auto-rerender
            in any situation. This
            Note that if this is set, you will have to manually rerender, such
            as in a <em>Script</em> CPart (<code>element.rerender()</code>), or
            in a custom CPart (<code>this.element.rerender()</code>) is
            invoked. This is useful if there are many events that don't cause
            changes (e.g. mouse movement), but you have discovered that the
            extra rerender invocations are impacting performance, even though
            they aren't generating patches to modify the DOM.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li><code>mode</code> - <em>default is <code>mode="regular"</code></em>.
    Specify mode to change the DOM root render mode of this component. This
    changes what is considered to be the root of the element, and thus where
    the content of the Template goes during reconciliation. In "regular" and
    "vanish", it's the custom component itself (which will be removed after
    rendering with "vanish"), in "shadow", it uses an attached shadow DOM as
    the root, and with "vanish-into-document" it replaces the entire page.
    This allows you to isolate outside CSS from your component using "shadow",
    do one-time renders only with "vanish", or make your component replace the
    entire document with "vanish-into-document". A detailed discussion of valid
    options are below:
        <ul>
            <li><code>mode="regular"</code> - The default behavior, where the
            content generated by this the element will be attached to the
            regular DOM, as the element itself. This means that CSS stylesheets
            attached the normal way (e.g. with a "link" tag) will affect the
            contents of this component. <em>Style</em> CParts are, however,
            automatically scoped to the component, so a selector like
            <code>p&nbsp;{...}</code> will get prefixed like
            <code>x-MyComp&nbsp;p&nbsp;{...}</code> when CSS files are being
            generated from <em>Style</em> CParts. Keep in mind the normal CSS
            rules will still apply, meaning that auto-scoped "p" tag will also
            affect children, grandchildren, etc of sub-components (unless those
            are "shadow" based).</li>

            <li><code>mode="shadow"</code> - Use the so-called "shadow DOM" to
            render the content generated by this component. While the
            <em>shadow DOM</em> may sound like a sci-fi villain, it's a
            mechanism browsers provide for custom elements to isolate their
            contents from CSS selectors or other JavaScript libraries. This
            isolation means means that CSS stylesheets attached the normal way
            (e.g. with a "link" tag) <em>will not</em> affect the contents of
            this element. Note that other than the isolation provided, the
            shadow mode should work exactly the same as regular. That said,
            <em>Style</em> CParts will still be automatically scoped to the
            component, but will use the shadowDOM feature to more strictly
            enforce that scoping. Note that shadowDOM CSS will <em>not</em> get
            included in the CSS file bundle, but instead will be bundled in the
            JavaScript source code. For a component by itself, switching from
            "shadow" to "regular" or vice-versa shouldn't change behavior at
            all. It's only useful when CSS from one component or a third party
            CSS library is "getting inside" your other components in an
            undesirable way, and you want to isolate them.</li>

            <li><code>mode="vanish"</code> - This less-used setting causes the
            component to "vanish" after rendering, or replace itself with it's
            children. Setting this will cause the component to remove itself
            after the first time it renders, effectively using the component as
            a simple template. All CParts will become useless after the first
            rendering, so CParts like <em>Script</em> or <em>State</em> are
            rarely useful in combination with this mode. This "one-time render"
            feature is most useful for static pages when you don't want your
            custom components to get in the way of the DOM that is generated,
            and for creating static-site generators, when you just want to
            generate plain HTML, with no Modulo JS or behavior in the end.</li>

            <li><code>mode="vanish-into-document"</code> - This setting is
            useful in one situation: When you want to create a "page" level
            component that changes tags that belong in the document head, such
            as <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>. Like with <code>mode="vanish"</code>
            described above, setting this will cause the component to remove
            itself after the first time it renders. However, with
            vanish-into-document, it will instead replace the entire page.
            It will also attempt to correctly insert all tags that belong in
            the document head (meta, title, link, script to be specific),
            causing link and script tags alike (e.g.
            <code>&lt;script src=".."&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>) to load.
            Finally, the document will be wiped, and anything else it finds
            will be put directly into the document's body, for a clean DOM
            structure that removes itself entirely during this "one-time
            render".</li>

            <li><code>mode="custom-root"</code> - This is rarely useful, but
            allows for setting some other DOM element as the new root element
            for the component to target for rendering it's content. This is
            done by assigning a value to <code>renderObj.component.root</code>
            before reconciliation. If no <code>.root</code> value is set, an
            error will occur.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>


<h3>Directives</h3>

<p>The <em>Component</em> defines 3 directives:</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>[component.event]</code> (<em>shortcut:</em> <code>@</code>) -
    Attach event listeners to DOM elements, and remove them when the DOM
    elements are removed. (For jQuery users, this is used for similar purposes
    as "live" (delegated) events, but is faster.)</li>

    <li><code>[component.dataProp]</code> (<em>shortcut:</em> <code>:</code>) -
    Attach data to a DOM element's <code>.dataProp</code> object, which can be
    used to directly pass <code>renderObj</code> values as <em>Props</em> or
    events</li>

    <li><code>[component.slot]</code> - Reattach the original child elements
    that this component had when it was first mounted to a new DOM element.
    (For React users, this is similar to doing
    <code>{this.props.children}</code>.) This can be used in addition to or
    instead of the <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code> interface. For more on the slot
    interface, see Mozilla's <a
    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/slot">"The
    Web Component Slot element"</a>.  Note that Modulo uses this interface for
    both <code>mode="shadow"</code> (e.g. using <code>shadowRoot</code> as the
    root element for reconciliation) and all the other DOM rendering modes
    (e.g. <code>mode="regular"</code>,
    <code>mode="vanish-into-document"</code>). For Shadow DOM, it will
    fall-back on Browser behavior. For everything else, it will detach any
    nodes it finds and reattach the nodes just before the beginning of the
    reconciliation process (it's DOM load-directive).</li>
</ul>



<mws-Section name="configuration">Configuration</mws-Section>


<p>Use a Configuration definition to configure Modulo at the global level, or
extend Modulo's functionality with JavaScript.</p>


<p>For example, suppose you wanted to configure Modulo to allow Components and
Libraries to be defined "loose" within the head of an HTML document, along with
the Modulo definition.  Here is an example of setting the
<code>modulo.config.domloader.topLevelTags</code> configuration attribute to do so:</p>

<mws-Demo
text='
<Configuration
    domloader.topLevelTags:=&apos;["component", "library", "modulo"]&apos;
></Configuration>
'></mws-Demo>


<p>Configuration can also be used as a script tag for more fine-grained
control. This will only be run once, within an isolated context, so temporary
variables are discarded.</p>


<mws-Demo
text='
<script Configuration>
    modulo.config.domloader.topLevelTags.push("library");
    modulo.config.domloader.topLevelTags.push("component");
    var myVar = "stuff"; // Note: not global
</script>
'></mws-Demo>


<p>Configuration's use as a Script tag becomes useful for integrating third
party libraries, as a sort of simple module and adapter system. Examine the
following for a complete example of registering the "snarkdown" module from NPM
as a templateFilter, allowing it to be used by components as a filter in the
HTML Templates:</p>

<mws-Demo
text='
<script Configuration -src="https://unpkg.com/snarkdown">
    modulo.register("templateFilter", snarkdown);
</script>
<Component name="HelloWorld">
    <Template>
        <textarea [state.bind] name="text"></textarea>
        <div>{{ state.text|snarkdown|safe }}</div>
    </Template>
    <State
        text="Hello *markdown* _world_"
    ></State>
    <Style>:host { display: flex; }</Style>
</Component>
'></mws-Demo>






<mws-Section name="library">Library</mws-Section>

<p>Use a Library to share Component "Library files" between components. The
most typical usage is in conjunction with <code>-src</code> and
<code>namespace</code>, as below:</p>


<mws-Demo
text='
<Library
    namespace="mylib"
    -src="./static/libraries/mylib.html"
></Library>
'></mws-Demo>

<h3>attrs</h3>

<p>Libraries use their attributes to configure the Components that they load.
That means their attributes are the same as the Component class attributes,
except they are "applied" across all child components.</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>namespace</code> - <em>default is <code>namespace="x"</code></em> -
    The namespace prefix that goes before the component when registering on the
    DOM. This is the most common thing you will set on a Library, since it
    allows you to "namespace" or isolate the components that you load and
    prevent names from conflicting. For example, you can import two Libraries,
    each with a <code>name="Modal"</code> component, but by giving them
    separate namespaces, you can distinguish them with something like
    <code>lib1-Modal</code> and <code>lib2-Modal</code>, instead of
    <code>x-Modal</code> for both, which would get confusing.</li>

    <li><code>mode</code> -  Override the default mode of loaded components.
    You can use this to force a Library to have vanishing components
    (mode="vanish"), or have components that isolate their style
    (mode="shadow"). Note that if you are loading somebody else's library this
    way, it may not work correctly (or at all!) if changing the mode in this
    way.
        <ul>
            <li><code>mode="shadow"</code>  - This will cause Components loaded
            by this Library tag to isolate their interior DOM. Note that if you
            are loading somebody else's library this way, it may not work
            correctly (or at all!) if changing the mode in this way.</li>

            <li><code>mode="vanish"</code> - This will cause Components loaded
            to "vanish" after rendering.</p>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li><code>namespace</code> - <em>default is <code>engine="ModRec"</code></em> -
    The Reconciler Engine selected. By default, ModRec, the built-in Modulo
    Reconciler engine, is enabled. If you want to experiment with other
    reconciliation engines, such as ones that might be faster or take into
    account unusual scenarios, set this equal to another property of
    <code>Modulo.reconcilers</code>.</li>

</ul>



<mws-Section name="modulo">Modulo</mws-Section>

<p>This is the "launching off point" or starting point of all Modulo projects
and Modulo code. The "Modulo" definition is what then contains Components,
Libraries, and others.</p>


<p>Modulo.js, while in "dev" mode (e.g. not the "built" version), will by
default search for a <em>Modulo</em> definition in a few different places:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>child of head</strong> - Defined already in the head (NOT
    nested in any tags) by the time the Script tag appears. It will read it
    synchronously, meaning synchronous tags will be registered immediately
    after loading the src="Modulo.js", blocking, inline with page load.
    This is the default way that embedded Modulo projects work, such as when
    you start with a blank file and paste in a Modulo snippet. Note that
    embedded (NOT using "-src=") core definition scripts (such as
    <em>Configuration</em>) will be run synchronously and blocking while the
    page is loading, possibly with the document open for writing.</li>

    <li><strong>child of body</strong> - Defined in the body at the top level
    (NOT nested in any tags).  Modulo.js will read it asynchronously after the DOM has
    finished parsing (the <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> event). This will
    happen if your src="Modulo.js" tag is in the body of a normally formed HTML
    page, or is loaded asynchronously or after the document has finished
    writing. Component registration will not be synchronous or blocking.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Example</h3>

<h4>Using a bare "Modulo" tag:</h4>

<p>Note that this is only good if it is NOT being embedded in an HTML document,
or if you are sure that it will not need any more complexity than this (simply
because things like Script tags and Style tags will not function correctly in
this situation, as they will get executed when the page loads causing "leakage").</p>

<mws-Demo
text='
<Modulo>
    <Configuration -src="./my-config-script.js""></Configuration>
    <Component name="HelloWorld">
        <Template>
            Hello <strong>Modulo</strong> World!
        </Template>
    </Component>
    <Library -src="./mylib.html"></Library>
</Modulo>
'></mws-Demo>



<h4>As a "template" tag, for embedding:</h4>

<mws-Demo
text='
<template Modulo>
    <Configuration -src="./my-config-script.js""></Configuration>
    <Component name="HelloWorld">
        <Template>
            Hello <strong>Modulo</strong> World!
        </Template>
    </Component>
    <Library -src="./mylib.html"></Library>
</template>
'></mws-Demo>


<h4>Condensed "script" tag:</h4>
<p>This example is in a single Script tag that also loads Modulo JS code (in
this case, using the unpkg CDN). It is ideal if you put all of your Modulo code
in another HTML file anyway (in this case, <code>/static/index.html</code>),
thus making a simple "4-liner" boilerplate for any page that needs your Modulo
component libraries:</p>

<mws-Demo
text='
<script Modulo
    src="//unpkg.com/mdu.js"
    -src="/static/"
></script>
