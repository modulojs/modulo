<h1>The Modulo Tutorial: Part 3</h1>



<p>In Part 3 of this tutorial, we'll dig deeper with two new CParts: State,
which allows individual components to store, modify, and link together data,
and Script, which allows custom JavaScript with complex behaviors.
Prerequisites: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Part 1 &amp; 2.</p>


<mws-Section name="state">State</mws-Section>

<p> So far, our components have been static and unchanging. They can't do a
lot. They might be useful for refactoring HTML into more DRY, reusable
components, but not much more than that.  They can't validate form data, use
APIs, or form complete applications. In fact, they can't have any sort of
<em>interaction</em> whatsoever, or any <em>dynamic</em> or changing
content.</p>


<h3>Examining a memory game's usage of State</h3>

<blockquote>
    <eg-Memory></eg-Memory>
</blockquote>

<p>Let's put on our "Holmes-style" detective hats and get out our detective
magnifying glasses, we're about to go sleuthing!
Examine this "Symbolic Memory Game" in the box here. Just like any other
component, this was placed on this HTML page here with the following code:
<code>&lt;eg-Memory&gt;&lt;/eg-Memory&gt;</code></p>

<p>However, this demo component is doing much more than what we have covered in
the tutorial so far. It is changing, or <em>mutating</em> based on user
interaction. This is no longer a simple, static component, but a
<em>dynamic</em> component.</p>

<p>We can deduce two things about this little memory game component. Deduction
One: It used a <em>State</em> CPart. We know that it used a <em>State</em>
CPart because it changes or mutates. Without a <em>State</em> CPart, a
component cannot "change state", or mutate or have dynamic content, and instead
will be rendered the same way every time (given certain props).
In other words, if a component needs to have dynamic content or change over
time, then a <em>State</em> CPart is necessary to store this dynamic content.</p>

<p>Now on to Deduction Two: It used a <em>Script</em> CPart. Script CParts
allow for complicated interactions and new behavior to be developed. Memory
game logic is complicated behavior that requires custom JavaScript. We'll get
to Script later on.</p>


<hr />

<blockquote> <p><strong>Why keep State separate?</strong>
Earlier jQuery-style JS frameworks were more concerned with manipulating the
DOM directly. Now, the modern approach is to combine templating and/or DOM
building tools (e.g. JSX, virtual DOM) with "state management" (e.g. Redux,
useState). This is due to perceived flaws with the original approach of direct
DOM manipulation: Pretty soon as an app grows, you get a big tangled mess of
different code reaching in different spots. Frontend frameworks clearly needed
an "MVC Model"-like structure to "keep stuff separate".</p>

<p>Modulo closely follows this modern approach. This "detangles" the spaghetti
mess of DOM manipulation: Instead of one button inserting stuff over here, and
one input reaching in and sending data over there, the "state" creates a single
"choke-point" that keeps data "flowing" in one direction. No matter what you
want changed, you do one thing: <em>Change state &amp; rerender</em>!</p>
</blockquote>



<h3>State is private</h3>

<p>State allows each component instance to store data. Each component instance
has a separate state from every other instance. As a demonstration of that,
examine the behavior of the following "Hello" counting buttons when clicked,
once again taken from the demo page:</p>

<p> <eg-Hello></eg-Hello> <eg-Hello></eg-Hello> <eg-Hello></eg-Hello> </p>

<p>(Source code:
<code>&lt;eg-Hello&gt;&lt;/eg-Hello&gt;</code>
<code>&lt;eg-Hello&gt;&lt;/eg-Hello&gt;</code>
<code>&lt;eg-Hello&gt;&lt;/eg-Hello&gt;</code>
)</p>

<p>Once again, we can determine that state is being used, as the text on the
button changes when that button is clicked. Furthermore, this demonstrates how
state is not shared: Each button is a totally separate instance that keeps
track of it's own separate number.</p>

<p>By the end of this third part, we will have examined every detail that goes
into this counting button, so you will be able understand it's code in full.</p>


<h3>Initializing the <em>State</em> CPart</h3>

<p>Let's "peel back the layers" and examine out how these "stateful" or dynamic
components were written.</p>


<p>In order for a component to be able to "modify state", we
must define a <em>State</em> CPart, conventionally placed after the Template
but before the Script or Style tags in a component definition (such that the
order is <em>Props, Template, State, Script, Style</em>). <em>State</em> CParts
are defined much like <em>Props</em>, except that instead of just listing the
attribute names, initial values must be provided as defaults.  A <em>State</em>
CPart might look like this:</p>

<pre>&lt;State
    count="1"
    color="blue"
&gt;&lt;/State&gt;</pre>


<p>Here we are defining two <em>state variables</em>: <code>count</code>, which
we initialize to equal <code>"1"</code>, and <code>color</code>, which we
initialize to equal <code>blue</code>. We can then use the state variables in
our <em>Template</em>, in a similar way to how we did with <em>Props</em>:</p>

<pre>&lt;Template&gt;
    &lt;p style="color: {{ state.color }}"&gt;
        You have {{ state.count }} bananas.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/Template&gt;</pre>

    <ol>
        <li>Practice modifying the <strong>State</strong> CPart
        (<code>&lt;State&gt;</code>) and re-running to see how that affects the
        output. Note that the <em>State</em> CPart is traditionally placed
        after the <em>Template</em>.</li>
        <li>Practice incorporating these CParts into your own components on a
        real page by copying the code here and pasting it within your component
        definition (that is, the one that you created in the <em>Part 1</em> of
        this tutorial)</li>

<mws-Section name="state">2. Directives</mws-Section>

<p>We'll get to more practice with the <em>State</em> CPart in a moment, but
first we need to take a little detour and learn about a few important built-in
Modulo "directives".</p>

<p>A <em>directive</em> is a type of HTML attribute.  You can recognize
<em>directive</em> by spotting certain special characters in the attribute
name.  For example, <code>&lt;input [state.bind] /&gt;</code> is an
<code>input</code> HTML tag with a <code>[state.bind]</code> directive. Some
directives will have a square-bracket syntax (e.g. <code>[ ]</code>), while
others might use other special characters to set them apart from "normal"
attributes (e.g.  <code>@</code> or <code>:</code>).  While re-rendering,
Modulo scans the resulting DOM to set-up or "mount" any directives it
encounters.</p>

<p>Directives are useful for a variety of tasks, ranging connecting CParts to
each other, to more complicated modifications to DOM elements. We'll learn two
directives next: <em>data prop</em> and <em>state.bind</em>.</p>


<h3>Data prop directive (:=)</h3>

<blockquote> <p><strong>Why don't we use "strings" for numbers?</strong> Using
strings of digits (i.e. in quotes) instead of the numbers themselves means that
things like arithmetic won't work as intended. Example: If state variable
<code>count="1"</code>, then <code>state.count + 10</code>
will result in <code>"110"</code> instead of the desired <code>11</code>, since
it's a string of digits, so <code>"1" + "10" = "110"</code></p></blockquote>

<p>Typically, when we add attributes to anything, whether it is a CPart or even
just in regular HTML, the attribute value can only be a string. This means when
we did <code>&lt;State count="1" ... &gt;</code> previously, we made a mistake:
The <code>count</code> variable didn't get assigned to <code>1</code> the
<em>Number</em>, but rather <code>"1"</code> the <em>String</em>. To fix it, we
do the following:</p>

<pre>&lt;State
    count:=1
    color="blue"
&gt;&lt;/State&gt;</pre>

<p>This is called a <em>data prop</em> directive. You can identify a <em>data
prop</em> directive (<code>:=</code>), by spotting an attribute name that is
suffixed with a colon right before the equal sign, like this:
<code>attributeName:=value</code>.</p>

<!--, resulting in a  <em>directive</em> the attribute name
with a colon right before the equal, -->

<p>The term <em>directives</em> in Modulo refers to special attributes that you
add to HTML to add extra functionality.  We'll explore more directives in this
section, but to learn more on <em>directives</em> in general, including how to
author your own directives, <a href="/docs/directives.html">see the section on
<em>Lifecycle & Directives</em></a>. However, most component developers will
have no need to use directives outside of the built-in directives that come
with Modulo, one of which we'll explore next: <code>[state.bind]</code></p>


<h3>Binding state data with [state.bind] directive</h3>


<blockquote><p><strong>State and predictability</strong> The purpose of
<em>State</em> is to separate out everything that changes about a component
into it's own isolated data structure. It should be the case that for a
well-written component, if anything changes visually, that "visual" change
should always start with changing state. There should never be a "mismatch", or
a way for visual changes to occur without state changes. If such a thing were
possible, it would imply a component that is non-deterministic, or renders
unpredictably. In other words, given a particular state (and props), a
component should be predictable or deterministic in that it renders the same
way every time.</p></blockquote>


<p>State comes with a directive that helps "bind" it to form data.  What does
this mean? You can attach a <code>[state.bind]</code> directive to any
<code>&lt;input&gt;</code>, and the <em>State</em> CPart will "sync up" the
input with the state after every keystroke. The binding is "two-way", or it
goes in both directions: The input gets the initial state value, and if the
state ever changes, the input will be updated to reflect that, and if the input
ever changes, the state gets updated.</p>


<p>It's best practice to bind all of your form inputs that are in components to
state variables. This is because in order to get the benefits of separating out
state, <em>all</em> visual changes, including something as simple as typing a
single character in an input, should be reflected in state changes.</p>

<p>To bind an input to state, use something like the following:</p>

<pre>&lt;Template&gt;
    &lt;input [state.bind] name="subject" /&gt;
&lt;/Template&gt;
&lt;State
    subject="Testing message..."
&gt;&lt;/State&gt;</pre>


<p>It's important that you always include a "name" attribute when binding. This
should contain the name of the <em>State</em> variable to be kept in sync with
that input.</p>



<section class="Tutorial-tryit">
    <h4>Try it now</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Try modifying the "Username" input box in the preview below. Do you
        see how it "quickly reacts" or re-renders the username text in
        lower-case as you type?</li>
        <li>Try also adjusting the "Opacity" input to see how it updates the
        transparency of the text, and the "Color" input, which only supports
        "blue" or "green" (anything else turns red).</li>
        <li>Examine the code in the <em>Template</em> CPart. Examine each
        input, and how it uses the <code>[state.bind]</code> directive to keep
        it in-sync with state. The <code>name="username"</code>,
        <code>name="color"</code>, and <code>name="opacity"</code> attributes
        are what the State CPart uses to figure out which state variable should
        be "linked".</li>
        <li>Now, practice the link in "the other way": That is, see how
        <em>State</em> populates the inputs' values. You can do this by
        changing the initial values of <em>State</em> and then re-running the
        program. See how by changing the initial values of <em>State</em> it
        will also update the initial values of the linked inputs?</li>
    </ol>


    <mws-Demo
        demotype="minipreview"
        fromlibrary="Tutorial_P3_state_bind"
    ></mws-Demo>

    <p>Clarification: The other attributes, (e.g. <code>name</code>, along with
    <code>type</code>, <code>max</code>, <code>min</code>, and
    <code>step</code>), are <em>not</em> Modulo directives, but are instead
    plain HTML attributes. The State CPart reuses <code>name</code>, but will
    ignore the others.</p>

    <p><strong>Further practice:</strong> Practice incorporating these CParts
    into your own components on a real page by copying the code here and
    pasting it within your component definition (that is, the one that you
    created in the <em>Part 1</em> of this tutorial)</p>

</section>


<h3>Final notes on directives</h3>



<ol>
    <li>If you are still scratching your head over the use of
    <code>[state.bind]</code> but are familiar with vanilla JS, it's
    all about reducing the need to "manually reach" into the DOM. It
    simplifies code like this <code>var inputData =
    document.getElementsByName('myinput')[0].value</code> (or the similar
    <code>$('[name=myinput]').val()</code> in jQuery), with more readable code
    like <code>state.myinput</code>, and similarly untangles code for
    validation, API requests, etc.</li>

    <li>Where do these "directives" come from? All directives
    are "provided" by a CPart. That is, including CParts in your component
    definition may "enable" more directives in your HTML. Data-prop is a built-in
    feature of <em>Components</em>, which means it's always available (technically,
    the <code>:=</code> syntax is in fact syntactic sugar for it's full name,
    <code>[component.dataProp]</code>).</p></li>

    <li>Keep in mind that <em>data props</em> directives are not the same as
    the <em>Props</em> CPart.  They are, however, related, in that the
    <em>Props</em> CPart looks for both regular attributes and data props: You
    can in fact set any <em>Props</em> attributes with the <code>:=</code>
    syntax, for data other than Strings.</li>

    <li><em>Data props</em> support any JSON literal type. Technically,
    <em>data props</em> values can have double quotes just like normal
    String-based attributes. However, as a stylistic convention, you may omit
    the double quotes for any one-word value, and should use only single quotes
    for complex types, such as JSON-formatted Arrays or Objects. See below for
    stylistic examples of data props with different types:

<mws-Demo
text='
<State
    color="blue"      (String)
    count:=1          (Number)
    ready:=true       (Boolean)
    speed:=null       (null value)
    items:=&apos;[         (JSON Array)
        "abc",
        "def"
    ]&apos;
    data_obj:=&apos;{      (JSON Object)
        "a": "b",
        "c": "d"
    }&apos;
></State>
'
></mws-Demo>
</li>


<mws-Section name="script">3. Script</mws-Section>

<p>While Modulo is designed to be useful even without JavaScript, sometimes you
just need access to that extra power of custom JavaScript code. Using
JavaScript, Modulo can be even used to develop more complicated interactive web
applications.</p>


<h3>The <em>Script</em> CPart</h3>


<p>To add JavaScript, use the <em>Script</em> CPart.  This CPart will execute
the JS code contained within once, immediately upon loading the component. See
this example:</p>

<pre>&lt;Script&gt;
    console.log("Hello JavaScript world!");
&lt;/Script&gt;</pre>


<p>In this above example, the <em>Script</em> CPart will execute that JS code
once, as soon as it's loaded, causing the "console.log" to log that message to
the web browser's Developer Tools JavaScript console exactly once.</p>

<h3>Embedded components and script tags</h3>

<p>Generally speaking, it's always desirable to put components in a separate
file, as was demonstrated in <em>Part 1</em> with the <code>-src=</code> style
attribute. This becomes even more necessary if you want to use a
<em>Script</em> CPart. This is because of a limitation with HTML: It does not
support "nested" script tags.  This means that the <code>&lt;/Script&gt;</code>
tag will end up closing off the outer <code>script</code> tag early and
"interrupting" your component definition.</p>

<p>However, there is an alternative syntax to still allow a <em>Script</em>
CPart embedded in your <code>&lt;script&nbsp;Modulo&nbsp;...</code> definition,
even without splitting it off. This messier syntax is far from ideal, but can
do in a pinch:</p>

<pre>&lt;cpart Script&gt;
    console.log("Hello JavaScript world!");
&lt;/cpart&gt;</pre>

<p>Note: Only use this alternative <code>cpart&nbsp;Script</code> syntax within
a <code>&lt;script&nbsp;Modulo&nbsp;...</code> tag. There is no reason to use
it when writing code in a separate file!</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Event directives</strong> Let's break down that event
directive: <code>@click:=script.sayHello</code>. First, note the at-sign:
<code>@</code>.  This is "syntactic sugar" for the
<code>[component.event]</code> directive. This will attach a "click" event
listener to the given element when that element is first mounted (i.e.
displayed on the screen), and remove the listener if it leaves. In this case,
we are using a <code>:=</code> style "data prop" style assignment, to assign
the click event to point to the sayHello function of the <em>Script</em> CPart.
All functions defined in a <em>Script</em> CPart will automatically be
"exported" and available to click events, or in dataprops in general.
</p></blockquote>

<h3>Attaching click events</h3>

<p>Typically, it's more useful to execute code when a user performs an action.
To do this, we must place the "console.log" into a function:</p>

<pre>&lt;Script&gt;
    function sayHello() {
        console.log("Hello JavaScript world!");
    }
&lt;/Script&gt;</pre>

<p>Then, attach a "click" event directive to a HTML tag, such as, for example,
a button element:</p>

<pre>&lt;button @click:=script.sayHello&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;</pre>

<p>Now, whenever a user clicks on the button, it will run the "sayHello"
function, logging the text into the JavaScript console.</p>

    <h4>Try it now</h4>
    <ol>

        <li>Bring up the console: Press <code>Control+Shift+J</code> (Linux,
        Windows) or <code>Command+Option+J</code> (macOS) on your keyboard to
        open the Console. Alternatively, you can right-click with your mouse
        and select "Inspect", and then go to the <em>Console</em> tab.</li>

        <li>Do you see the "COMPONENT GOT LOADED!" text displayed in the
        console? It is displayed once every time the component is loaded. By
        clicking "RUN", you can "reload" the component, causing that message to
        show (or count up) again.</li>

        <li>Try now clicking on the button in the preview on the right. Do you
        see how every time you click it shows (or counts) the text of the
        console.log in the console?</li>

        <li><em>Extra:</em> Any number of functions can be defined in a
        <em>Script</em> CPart. Practice writing your own function that console
        logs a different message, and then attaching it to a new button (or the
        existing button).</li>

        <li><em>Extra:</em> The "event" directive supports any event. Try
        changing "@click" to "@mouseover", and then move your mouse over the
        button (without clicking). (For the curious: <a
    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events#event_listing">
    MDN has a list of all events</a>)</li>

<h3>Interacting with state</h3>

<p>The <em>Script</em> CPart is like the <em>Template</em> CPart in one way:
You get variables referencing the other CParts.  Within functions defined in
the <em>Script</em> CPart, variables will be available representing the other
CParts that have been defined in the <em>Component</em>.  As with the
<em>Template</em> CPart, the most useful variables are <code>state</code>, with
the current data in <em>State</em> CPart (the "data" Object), and
<code>props</code>, with the value of the attributes that were passed to this
component.</p>

<p>Remember our "Holmes-style" detective work we did in the beginning? We
looked at a button which incremented a value when clicked. The JavaScript code
to increment a variable is <code>num++</code>, and for state data it can be:
<code>state.num++</code>. Also, by default, components will rerender after
every event that you are listening to. With that in mind, examine the code of
the Hello button:</p>

<mws-Demo
text='
<Template>
    <button @click:=script.countUp>Hello {{ state.num }}</button>
</Template>
<State
    num:=42
></State>
<Script>
    function countUp() {
        state.num++;
    }
</Script>
'
></mws-Demo>

<p>By clicking on the button, it will increment the state value. Since the
component will rerender after the click, it will then change the DOM to show
the new number.</p>

<p>With the power of JavaScript, you can do all manner of things with the
Script tag. The <a href="/demos/">Example page</a> has all sorts of examples of
more complicated apps and applications. The typical use of a Script tag, thus,
is to create custom logic that manipulates or "puppets" the state, which in
turn is what controls the rendering of the component's HTML code by the
Template CPart.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that the Script CPart is intended to be limited. Serious
JavaScript development should be split into separate JS files, or defined as
custom CParts. Thus, think of the Script CPart as more "filling in the gaps"
between CParts, which should do most of the heavy lifting (e.g. asynchronous
code, complicated API calls or data transformation, etc).</p>



<h4>Key terms</h4>

<ul>
<li> <strong>State</strong> - A CPart used to include changing data, which is
used to render the HTML of the component</li>

<li><strong>Directive</strong> - A special type of HTML attribute that "hooks
in" functionality to otherwise plain HTML elements. Three built-in directives
include:

    <ul>
        <li><code>[state.bind]</code> - two-way binds inputs to state variables, so
        modifying the input modifies the variable, and vice-versa</li>

        <li><code>:=</code> - "data-prop" assignment, allowing for assigning to
        JavaScript values such as functions and/or primitive JavaScript data types in JSON syntax</li>

        <li><code>@click</code> - attach event listener to element</li>
    </ul>
</li>

<li>
<strong>Script</strong> - CPart that enables embedding of arbitrary JavaScript
code, and allowing for easy access to CPart interface, and exposing JS
functions to be attached as events
</li>
</ul>


<h4>Next step</h4>

<p>That's all for the Modulo tutorial! Modulo is still in early development, so
it's likely the tutorial will expand in the future to cover more aspects of
Modulo development.</p>
