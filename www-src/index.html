        <p><strong>Zero set-up</strong> - Like the "golden age" of jQuery,
        just drop it into any HTML file.  Unlike jQuery, that 1 file packs
        in many of the creature-comforts of a modern component framework,
        without any dependencies or new syntax to learn. You can even compile
        to a single JS file, directly from your browser!</p>
        <!--
        a modern component system, a swappable templating language based on
        Liquid-syntax, DOM resolution, and more.  , a tiny build system to pack
        your CSS and JS for production, and even debug tools.</p>-->

        <p><strong>A gentler learning curve</strong> - Modulo's declarative,
        synchronous HTML-first approach was designed to be easier for coding
        newbies to pick-up&mdash;in fact, useful components can be developed
        without writing any JavaScript code!</p>

        <p><strong><strike style="color: gray">Progressive Web Apps</strike>
        Progressive Enhancement</strong> - Modulo makes few assumptions, and
        renders components mixed with plain HTML for easier integration into
        backend apps. SPA's and PWA's are fine and all, and Modulo could be
        used for these as well, but what about all our existing server-side
        apps in Ruby on Rails, Python, Go, or that one home-grown PHP monster
        that will never go away? Sprinkle in some Modulo components to make
        your "traditional" web apps
        <em>shine</em>.</p>
        <!--

        <p><strong>Component Parts</strong> - Modular "Lego blocks" for
        your components! Combine Script, Style, State, Props, and Templates to
        make components that with these features.<!--
        Reusing CParts between components provides a powerful system
        of "composition-based" inheritance.--></p>

        <p><strong>Everything is transparent and swappable</strong> -
        Component Parts (CParts) are a flexible form of component middleware:
        You can create custom CParts to support your backend APIs, "mix and
        match" your favorite JS templating languages (e.g., <a
        href="/demos/jsx_template.html">JSX</a> or <a
        href="/demos/handlebars_templater.html">Handlebars</a>), or fine-tune
        DOM-resolution behavior, either globally, or on a per-component basis.
        Lifecycle callbacks are especially powerful, allowing you to hook your
        own code into the DOM or any steps of the rendering process.</p>

        <p><strong>A novel approach to component development</strong> -
        Modulo's separation of CPart development from component development
        allows JavaScript developers to write <a
          title="Click for a demonstration of a custom CPart that wraps an API"
          href="/demos/custom_cpart_for_api.html">pure JS to wrap APIs</a>, and
        component developers to tie it all together with "low-code".</p>

        <p><strong>"It's like React"</strong> - Modulo is "batteries-included"
        to function like React.js or Vue.js. You get encapsulated components
        with state management, two-way data binding, props, computed values,
        smart DOM resolution, event directives, and more. You even get a simple
        importing and namespacing system, which can "self-pack" your components
        into a single JS file!</p>

        <p><strong>Clean & concise</strong> - The code-base of Modulo itself is
        intentionally kept short &amp; sweet: It's roughly 1500
        <abbr title="Source Lines of Code - This counts 'physical lines' and thus does not include comments, documentation, blanks, etc">SLOC</abbr>,
        80 char line limit, 4 spaces of
        indent, and a <abbr title="Try to keep cyclomatic complexity of functions to 3 or lower">low-complexity</abbr>
        imperative style. When something goes wrong (which it
        probably will since it's new), it's easier to "<tt>git blame</tt>"
        Modulo.</p>

        <p><strong>A basis for whatever comes next</strong> - Writing your own
        framework? Modulo's core for loading &amp; mounting CParts is only ~500
        SLOC. Read the source code, fork away, and swap the
        "batteries-included" for your own!</p>
